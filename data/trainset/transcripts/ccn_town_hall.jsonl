I think it’s a very sad thing for our country. I think it’s a very sad thing, frankly, for the world, because, if you look at what’s gone to our country, our country has gone to hell. Our borders are bad. Our military has been bad. You look at the taxes, you look at inflation, what’s happened to inflation, it’s just destroying our country.

But, you know, when you look at Antifa, what they’ve done to Portland, and if you look at Antifa, look at what they’ve done to Minneapolis and so many other – so many other places, look at what they did to Seattle.

These people – I’m not trying to justify anything, but you have two standards of justice in this country, and what they’ve done – and I love that question because what they’ve done to see many people is nothing – nothing. And then what they’ve done to these people, they’ve persecuted these people. And yeah, my answer is I am most likely – if I get in, I will most likely – I would say it will be a large portion of them. You know, they did a very – and it’ll be very early on.

My question is regarding the economy. Over the past two years, we have seen the prices for everything skyrocket, from food to gas to utilities and insurance costs. Many peoples’ bills are up several hundred dollars a month, including mine. If elected president, again, what is the first thing you would do to help bring down the cost to make things more affordable?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you. Drill, baby, drill. Well, we were energy independent. We were soon going to be energy dominant. And nobody had ever done what I did. We got oil down to $1.87. Actually, it fell lower than that in some cases. We’d have to save the oil companies – the price was getting. So, we were doing incredibly. We had the greatest economy in the history of our country, probably the greatest economy in the history of the world. We’re energy independent, soon to be energy dominant. We were going to be bigger than Russia and Saudi Arabia put together times two. We have more liquid gold under our feet than any other nation – any other nation. And these stupid fools ended it. And energy went from $1.87 and even lower for gasoline, for a car. They went from $1.87 to $5, $6, $7, $8 and even $9, and your electricity bills went through the roof. Your heating bills went through the roof. And that’s what started inflation. And it hasn’t stopped because people are paying now for bacon and for eggs and for the – two and three times what it was just a little while ago. We created the greatest economy in history. A big part of that economy was I get – I got you the biggest tax cuts in the history of our country, bigger than the Reagan cuts, bigger than any –. And also, Kaitlan, also, as you know, we got the biggest regulation and regulatory cuts. We – this place was rocking, and then we were given a gift from China. And China paid a big price. And let me tell you something, I took in hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes from China. But prior to COVID coming in – and then I rebuilt the economy again a second time. But we had prior to COVID coming in as – from China, from Wuhan, which I said it came from Wuhan, and everybody said, oh, you’re wrong about that. You’re wrong. It came from Wuhan. I said it right from day one. So we had the greatest economy in the world, is historic. They made energy so high, and energy is all invasive. It is massive as an industry and as a cost. It lifted everything."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mr. President, staying on the economy – If you made do – if you made donuts, if you made – no matter what you did, and we had inflation the likes of which – I guess we have, as you said, for 52 years, but I think more than that, we had no inflation, we had the lowest energy prices we’ve had in decades. This country was rocking and rolling. And by the way, we had the most secure border in the history of our country and now we have – Mr. President, we have – we have more questions on the economy. I want to make sure we get to all of those. As you know, the U.S. could be three weeks away from defaulting on its debt.

We had to keep this country alive because it was so serious. But we have to get the country back. We have to lower energy prices. We have to lower interest rates. Interest rates are through the roof. Energy has to come down, it all has to come down and we have to start paying off debt."}]}

I think, if the Republicans hold strong and they say “We want five” – let’s say, “We want $5 trillion off,” I really think the Democrats have no choice but to do it.

For instance, schools, we would harden, very – very much harden – and I also, I’m a very believer – I believe in teachers; I love teachers. I think they’re incredible, and they love the children – not quite like the parents, but they love the children, in many cases, almost as much. Many of these teachers are soldiers, ex-soldiers, ex-policemen. They’re people that really understand weapons. And you don’t need – 5 percent of the teachers would be more than you could ever have if you’re going to hire security guards. But in addition to that, have security guards. You have to harden your entrances. You have to make schools safe. And you can make other places safe. But it is a big mental health problem in this country more than anything else. And remember, we have 700 million guns – 700 million. Many people, if they don’t have a gun, they’re not going to be very safe. I mean, if they don’t have a gun – it gives them security. Now, you need them for entertainment; you need them for hunting; you need them for a lot of different things. But there are people that, if they didn’t have the privilege of having a gun in some form, they – many of them would not be alive today. You know, there’s a certain country that had a very strict policy on guns, very, very strict."}]}

He said, “Go out and buy guns.” People went out and bought guns, and it went way down. The numbers went down because they had security. If you look at Chicago, Chicago has the single toughest gun policies in the nation. They are so tough, you can’t breathe; New York, too, and other places also.

It’s such a great question, and it was such a great victory. And people are starting to understand it now. You know that they wanted to bring it back to the states, but that was probably the least important part of that victory. Getting rid of Roe v. Wade was an incredible thing for pro-life because it gave pro-life something to negotiate with. Pro-life had absolutely nothing, being stuck in Roe v. Wade to negotiate with.

And you have to – I happen to believe in the exceptions, the life of the mother, rape, incest, like Ronald Reagan believed in the exceptions. But I happen to believe that.

I’ve given you the answer probably four times already. I’m looking – I’m looking at a solution that’s going to work – very complex issue for the country. You have people on both sides of an issue. But we are now in a very strong position. Pro-life people are in a strong position to make a deal that’s going to be good and going to be satisfactory for them. If you weren’t able to get rid of – you wouldn’t even be having a discussion if you weren’t able to get rid of Roe v. Wade, which put pro-life in a dead position, a horrible position. They could kill the baby at any time they wanted to. But we did something that nobody thought was do-able. And other Republican presidents, and others, by the way, they wanted to get it out.

You’re going to have millions of people pouring into our country right now at a level that nobody has ever seen before. These people are sick. Anybody that wants this to happen to our country, they’re destroying our country. And this should not be allowed to happen, how they’re not going to do a version of Title 42 or my Title 42, which was tough.

They’re living in Central Park in New York City. The city is being swamped. Los Angeles is being swamped. Iowa is being swamped. Our whole country is being destroyed. Millions of people are coming into our country. And you know what the number is going to be, in my opinion, by the end of the year, not the 4 million that you hear and the 3 million.

It’s very simple to – you’re a nasty person, I will tell you."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Can you answer why you – why you held onto the document?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Very simple. I was negotiating, and we were talking to NARA – that’s Washington – to bring whatever they want. They can have whatever they want. When we left Washington, we had the boxes lined up on the sidewalk outside for everybody. People are taking pictures of them. Everybody knew we were taking those boxes. And the GSA, the Government Service, the GSA was the one taking them. They brought them down to Mar-a-Lago. We were negotiating with NARA. All of a sudden, they raid our house. When Biden has his documents, he won’t give back the 1,850 boxes. And you’re going to find some real gems in there."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "But it was Biden who alerted them that he had the documents."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So, you– – have all these different sets of – all these different set of–"}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "The National Archives reached out to you to get your documents back. Why did you not turn them over when you got a subpoena asking for you to turn them over?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Because we were negotiating with them. We were negotiating with them, as per, as per the Presidential Records Act. We were negotiating with NARA. Very nice people, but they got to love our Constitution a little bit more, because – and they shouldn’t red-flag it, by the way. Very nice people. We were negotiating with NARA, and that’s what the Presidential Records Act says, because Richard Nixon, surprisingly, had problems. And he had a lot of problems dealing with NARA, and they ended up passing legislation– called the Presidential Records Act just for this kind of a thing. We were dealing with them."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Well, that’s why they created–"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We were talking to them. Excuse me. Wait a minute."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "But I just explained to you why."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Why? Eighteen hundred and 50 boxes. OK. Why didn’t – no, he – they didn’t take them."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "My question for you, though, when it comes to documents, do you still have any classified documents in your possession?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Are you ready? No. No, I don’t have anything. I have no classified documents. And, by the way, they become automatically declassified when I took them."}, {"role": "user", "content": "No, you had to declassify them."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "But why – let me ask you a question. Why is it that Biden had nine boxes in Chinatown? And he gets a lot of money from China. Why is that? And why–"}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "There is no evidence of that, Mr. President. No, you cannot–"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And why don’t they put this guy Jack Smith and his group of – and his group of thugs–"}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "What you’re referring to is an office that he had. Mr. President, I need to stop you right there, because there’s no evidence of what you just said there."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "No, no. That’s at the University of Pennsylvania."}, {"role": "user", "content": "He had a temporary office. But I want to ask you about another investigation that you’re facing."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "You’re so wrong. You don’t know the subject."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "I do know the subject. And I do know the facts, Mr. President."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "He had one at University of Pennsylvania, but he also had nine boxes in Chinatown."}]}

It was a perfect phone call."}, {"role": "user", "content": "At the center of that – let me finish my question. At the center of that is that call that you had with the secretary of state– Brad Raffensperger."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Perfect call. Yes, sure."}]}

I thought it was a rigged election. I thought it had a lot of problems. I had every – I guess he’s secretary of state. I called – listen to this. There are like seven lawyers on the call, many of them from there. We’re having a call. We’re having a normal call. Nobody said, oh, gee, he shouldn’t have said that. Why – if this call was bad – I questioned the election."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You asked him to find you votes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "If this call was bad – I didn’t ask him to find anything. Let me just tell you – If this call was bad – I said, you owe me votes because the election was rigged. That election was rigged. And if this call was bad, why didn’t him and his lawyers hang up? How dare you say that? This was a perfect phone call."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "We have heard the audiotape, Mr. President. There’s an audio of you asking him to find you 11,000-something votes."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "This was a call that was made to question the results of election. And we have – and when we can’t make a call to question election results, then this country ought to just forget about it."}]}

And I should note that, of course –"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "I was questioning the election."}, {"role": "user", "content": "You weren’t just questioning the election results. You were asking him to find you votes. And I should note that there is no evidence of fraud. There is no rigged election in the state of Georgia. I want to get back to the audience, though, Mr. President, because those are false claims you’re making about what happened in Georgia. John – Jordan Sullenberger is here. He’s an undeclared voter from Hollis. He voted for you in 2020. Jordan, what is your question for President Trump tonight? Thank you, Mr. Trump. I’m 26. I’m a veteran. I help manage a private aviation company. I’d love one, yes. I’m not for mandates or government interference in private business."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thank you very much. You want a job? I’m looking – I’m looking for somebody very good. Right. Well, I’m the one that really wants to protect you. All of these fake investigations of me are about election interference. They think, because I’m leading Biden by 11 points, seven points, nine points, I’m leading DeSanctimonious by a lot – by 40 points or 45 points. I think he ought to just relax and take it easy and think about the future, because, right now, his future is not looking so good. I will tell you this. We are really putting it to Biden, but he’s putting it to himself, because the economy stinks, inflation is horrible, and the border is a disaster. And, by the way, the way he got out of Afghanistan was the single most embarrassing moment in the history of our country."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "Mr. President, I have one more question for you here tonight. And I think, while we’re in front of the voters here in New Hampshire – in New Hampshire, this is a fundamental question for you. You are running in the 2024 race. If you are the Republican nominee and you are in that 2024 race, will you commit tonight to accepting the results of the 2024 election?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yes, if I think it’s an honest election, absolutely, I would. Do you want me to answer it again? If I think it’s an honest election, I would be honored to. And, right now, we are so far ahead of both Democrat and Republican. And you know what? If I don’t win, this country is going to be in big trouble. It’s so sad to see what’s happening."}]}
