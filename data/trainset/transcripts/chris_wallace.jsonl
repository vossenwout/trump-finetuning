It's many countries. We don't talk about it in the news. They don't talk about Mexico and Brazil and still parts of Europe which actually got hit sooner than us. So it's a little ahead of us in that sense. But you take a look, why don't they talk about Mexico, which is not helping us.

The White House went with this chart from the European CDC which shows Italy and Spain doing worse, but countries like Brazil and South Korea doing better. Other countries doing better, like Russia, aren't included in the White House chart. California, locking down again. Florida, deadliest day of the entire pandemic. Hospitals at capacity. A number of places around the country. Shortages of testing. Shortages of personal protective equipment for nurses and doctors. A lot of people say this is because we don't have a national plan.

I supplied everybody. Now we have somewhat of a surge in certain areas and other areas. We're doing great, but we have a surge in certain areas. But you don't hear people complaining about ventilators. We've got all the ventilators we can use. We're supplying them to other countries. We go out into parking lots and everything. Everybody gets a test. We find if we did half the testing. With all of that being said, I'm glad we did it. This is the right way to do it. I'm glad we did what we're doing.

Many of them, don't forget. I guess it's like 99.7% people are going to get better, and in many cases they're going to get better very quickly. We go out and we look and then on the news, look, if you go back to the news, all of your, even your wonderful competitors, you'll see cases are up. Cases are up. Many of those cases shouldn't even be cases. Cases are up because we have the best testing in the world and we have the most testing. No country has ever done what we've done in terms of testing. We are the envy of the world. They call and they say the most incredible job anybody's done is our job on testing. Because we're going to very shortly be up to 50 million tests. You look at other countries, they don't even do tests. They do tests. If somebody walks into the hospital, they're sick, they're really sick. They test them then, or they'll test them in a doctor's office. But they don't go around, have massive areas of testing. And we do, and I'm glad we do. But it really skews the numbers."}]}

No. And I don't agree with the statement that if everybody wear a mask, everything disappears. Hey, Dr. Fauci said, don't wear a mask. Our surgeon general, terrific guy, said, don't wear a mask. Everybody was saying, don't wear a mask. All of a sudden, everybody's got to wear a mask. And as you know, masks cause problems, too. With that being said, I'm a believer in masks. I think masks are good. But I leave it up to the governors. Many of the governors are changing. They're more mask into. They like the concept of masks, but some of them don't agree. I do say this. Schools have to open. Young people have to go to school. And there's problems when you don't go to school, too.

The Supreme Court gave the president of the United States powers that nobody thought the president had by approving, by doing what they did, their decision on daca. And DACA is going to be taken care of also, but we're getting rid of it because we're going to replace it with something much better, but we got rid of already, which was most of Obamacare, the individual mandate, and that I've already won on.

Everybody says it. It's going to be interesting to see what happens, but with tremendous evidence right now as to how unfairly treated I was. President Obama and Biden spied on my campaign. It's never happened in history. If it were the other way around, the people would be in jail for 50 years right now. That would be Comey. That would be Brennan. That would be all of this. The two lovers, Strzok and Page, they would be in jail now for many, many years. They would be in jail. It would have started two years ago, and they'd be there for 50 years.
