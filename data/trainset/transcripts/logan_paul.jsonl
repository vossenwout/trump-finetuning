Why are you doing this to Germany? I said, we're defending you under NATO, and you're paying billions of dollars a month to Russia. I mean, we're defending you, and you're giving the people. We're defending you from. We're giving you the defense, but you're giving them money at massive amounts. Probably the biggest project, you know, most important, one of the most important projects they've ever done. I ended it. It was dead. It was gone. And then this guy comes in and he approves it, but he kills Keystone, you know, the Keystone XL. So it's sad. But Putin said to me, that's the biggest thing. You ended it. You ended the pipeline. He said, they all say you and I are friendly, but I'd hate to see you as an enemy. But this was the biggest, you know, this was massive amounts of money."}]}

Just under 2000 nuclear weapons. And we do also. And when you have nuclear weapons, and even if you don't have nuclear weapons, getting along is good. But be the tough one. Be the smart one. Get along is good. I tell the press all the time, no, the fact that I get along with Kim Jong un, North Korea, that's crazy. President Xi, that's crazy. It's all good stuff, getting along. But nobody ever took money out of China like me. I took hundreds of billions of dollars out in the form of tariffs and taxes. No other president took not ten cents. And, you know, China built their military because of the United States. The United States was giving them hundreds of billions of dollars a year in excess flow. Nobody's ever seen anything like it. But we took out hundreds of billions of dollars from China. And I still got along with President Xi until Covid. That was sort of. That was a breaking point. But no, but he was a guy that I respected, liked, he liked me and I liked him. That's a good thing, not a bad thing. You know, the press says, oh, isn't it? You say, yeah, he's a leader. He's a smart guy. They say, smart man, they say, oh, Trump said he was smart. That's. Yeah, he leads 1.4 billion people. He's. Yeah, it's a little bit on the smart side, but I got along with him. I got along with Kim Jong un. That would have been a nuclear war if Hillary Clinton had gotten in office, we would be in a. We would have been in a nuclear war with North Korea. He was ready for it. When I was with him, nobody else could meet him. All of a sudden, the dam broke and we started talking a little bit. We got together, as you know, twice. We got along very well, but we were in no danger from them, and we were in serious danger before I got there.

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "There's a lot of people that are still kind of wrapped up in that world, and I just want to ask you some questions. In 2023, the deacs, more than 80 million fentanyl laced fake pills, 12,000 pounds of fentanyl powder. There's so many people out there on the streets right now without access to resources, with mental health, for mental health care, rehabilitation centers. What's your plan to continue to stem the. The flow of fentanyl into the country, as well as help the people who have already fallen victim to the opiate epidemic?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "So when I took over, you know, it was drug infested. When I ran in 2016, I ran on the border, and I fixed the border, and I couldn't even use it in 2020 in the campaign, even though I got millions of more votes than I got the first time, I couldn't talk about the border because I fixed it. And I'd say to my people, I want to talk about the border. I was proud of the job we did. We had it fixed. It was really in good shape. And drugs were at the lowest point in years. And not only people, drugs, human trafficking, which is such a horrible thing. You think of it as like an ancient kind of a crime, and it's bigger now than ever before because of the Internet. You know, the Internet has made a lot of these things much bigger than they have ever been. When you think of human trafficking, mostly in women, by the way, people don't know that. Mostly in women, where they put them in trunks of cars, they have compartments. It's so horrible. And I had it down to a real. To the lowest level, just about, I guess, in recorded, recorded times. So what you have to do is you have to be very tough on that. We had a deal on the fentanyl is pouring through. I bought millions of dollars worth of equipment, believe it or not. They call it sniffing equipment, but believe it or not, the best thing to find it. You can spend millions of dollars on equipment and machinery to find drugs coming through, like, you know, sort of finds it. The best thing is a german shepherd born in a circle. You know that. Oh, they're unbelievable. They can. They go right to it. It's not even. There is no machine. You spend two and a half million dollars for machinery, and the dog is much better. More dogs and more dogs. We literally bred those dogs. It's a very specific type of german shepherd from a certain part of the world. It's the most incredible thing. We worked very, very hard on that. I was with President Xi. It comes from China, and it comes in through the southern. So Mexico comes through the southern border. And I was with President Xi, and I told you we got along great. You know, the COVID was a step too far as far as I was concerned, but we got along great. And I said, do you have a drug problem? He said, no, they give the death penalty in China if you sell drugs. I said, I'd like you to give the death penalty to people that are making fentanyl and sending it over to our country. And he was going to do that. And then we had the election result. And of course, Biden never picked up that conversation. I told them about it, but he was going to give the death penalty if he did that. You would have had this literally stopped, almost stopped. But we have to be very, very strong at the border. This is really, this is a plague. Like, and you know, the numbers, they'd say 70,000, 80,000. I think it's probably 250 or 300,000. This is like a war. There's rarely a war. I mean, how many wars are we losing? 300,000 people a year? And everybody knows a family, I know many families where their children die and they're not even addicted. They take a pill that's unrelated and it's got a little bit of fentanyl. They say you can take the head of a needle and you just put a piece on there, and that's enough to kill, like, ten people. It is a really horrible thing. And I would have had China giving their maximum penalty. They would not have been sending it. And I had a deal worked out with President Xi. But of course, Biden didn't follow up, just like he didn't follow up on the Abraham Accords, which would have been a great thing to do. So we have to be very tough on the border, and that includes drugs as well as people, as well as people not coming in from jails and prisons and mental institutions, which is, which is happening now at levels that nobody's ever seen before. It's crazy. How can it be good? It's so bad? And I guess they're either stupid, which they're not, they hate our country, or they want to get these people for votes. A lot of people think that's the thing. They want to get them for votes. But the destruction, the damage that Biden's done to our country by having 16, 17 million people already in, you know, it's much more than they say. It's probably 17. It could be even higher than that in our country. And these are not people that are going to make America great again. These are people that have a lot of issues and we're going to have a lot of issues as long as they're here and we're going to get them out.

If you were a lip reader, you'd say, it's absolutely perfect. And that's scary in particular in one way. If you're the president of the United States and you announced that 13 missiles have been sent to, let's not use the name of a country. We have just sent 13 nuclear missiles heading to somewhere, and they will hit their targets in twelve minutes and 59 seconds, and you're that country, and there's no way of detach. You know, I asked Elon, is there any way that, like, Russia or China can say that that's not really President Trump? He said there's no way."}]}

You got like twelve minutes and let's check the code. Gee, how's everything doing? So what do they do when they see this, right? They have maybe a counterattack. It's so dangerous in that way. Okay. In another way, it's so incredible that what they do is so incredible. I've seen it. I just got back from San Francisco. I met with incredible people in San Francisco, and we talked about this. This subject is hot on their plates. You know, the super geniuses. And they gave us, they gave me $12 million for the campaign, which, you know, four years ago they probably wouldn't have. We had thousands of people on the streets. You saw it, which just happened this last weekend. I met with incredible people, actually, and this is their big. This is what everyone's talking about with all of the technology. These are the real technology people. They're talking about AI, and they showed me things, but I've seen things that are so, you wouldn't even think it's possible. But in terms of copycat, now, to a lesser extent, they can make a commercial. I saw this. They made a commercial me promoting a product and it wasn't me. And I said, did I make that commercial? Did I forget that I made that commercial? It is so unbelievable. So it brings with it difficulty, but we have to be at the forefront. It's going to happen. And if it's going to happen, we have to take the lead over China. China is the primary threat in terms of that. And you know, what they need more than anything else is electricity. They have to have electricity, massive amounts of electricity. I don't know if you know that in order to do these, essentially it's a plant and the electricity needs are greater than anything we've ever needed before to do AI at the highest level. And China will produce it because they'll do whatever you have to do. Whereas we have environmental impact people and we have a lot of people trying to hold us back, but massive amounts of electricity are needed in order to do AI. And we're going to have to generate a whole different level of energy. And we can do it. And I think we should do it, but we have to be very careful with it. We have to watch it. But it's, you know, the words you use were exactly right. It's the words a lot of smart people are using. You know, there are those people that say it takes over, it takes over the human race. It's really powerful stuff, AI. So let's see how it all works out. But I think as long as it's."}, {"role": "user", "content": "There, it's just, and that's just AI. What about when it becomes si or super intelligent?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Yeah, yeah, no, then they'll have super AI, right? Super duper AI. But, but what they, what it does is so crazy. Now it can also be really used for good. I mean, things can happen. I had a speech rewritten by AI out there, one of the top people. He said, oh, you're going to make a speech? Yeah. He goes, click, click, click. And like 15 seconds later he shows me my speech. That's crazy. That's crazy so beautifully I said, I'm going to use this sucker. I'm going to, I'm gonna, I've never seen anything like it."}]}

This was so crazy. It took it and it made it unbelievable. And it's, and so fast. You just say, I'm writing a speech about these two young, beautiful men that are great fighters and sort of great at a lot of things and tell me about them and say some nice things and period. And then that comes out. Logan in particular is a great champion. Jake is also good. See, I'm doing that only because you have no. It comes out with the most beautiful writing. So one industry, I think that will be gone are these wonderful speech writers. I've never seen anything like it. And so quickly, a matter of literally minutes, it's. It's done. So it's a little bit scary."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Well, as you said, let's see how this plays out.
