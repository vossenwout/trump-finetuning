You know, what about make America great again, right? That's what we care about. Okay, here we go. So this is a famous pen now, and we'll put it with something. I'll ask you to do whatever you think we should do with it. Mr. Secretary, do you want to talk about, you know, doubt. Secretary of the Interior, and also working with Chris Wright on extracting vast amounts of oil and gas and making our country rich. Would you like to say something?"}]}

We signed a secretarial order as Secretary of interior, directing the U.S. geologic Survey. WHO is responsible for the database, which is the geographic names informational system. And so just prior to this signing, if you will, the button was pushed. It became official with this proclamation to call today Gulf of America Day. But now it's going out. As we're sitting here right now, team is calling all the map providers, so Google Maps, Apple Maps, all the map people. That change will take effect this afternoon to Gulf of America. So, again, fantastic. Thank you, President Trump, for setting this all in motion with your executive order. It's an exciting, exciting, fun day, and great to do this as we're flying over the Gulf of America."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "We thought it would be very appropriate.

What's your take on that?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Well, we're going to see what happens. We have a long way to go and we're talking about fraud, waste, abuse. And when a president can't look for fraud and waste and abuse, we don't have a country anymore. So we're very disagreeable, disappointed with the judges that would make such a ruling. But we have a long way to go. We have to look, we have to find all of the fraud that's going on. We have tremendous fraud, tremendous waste and tremendous abuse and theft by the way. And the day you're not allowed to look for theft and fraud, et cetera, then we don't have much of a country. So no judge should be, no judge should frankly be allowed to make that kind of decision is a disgrace."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "Mr. President, years ago, Gulf of America, Canada, Greenland, Gaza, all these are very muscular foreign policy. How does this align with America?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "First, because it makes us bigger, stronger and better and more protective. We need Greenland because of national security, international security, world security, world peace. And we're have to do that. Canada. We'll see what happens with Canada. But the people of Canada would be paying less than half of the tax. If you look at the tax, they're going to be paying less than half the tax. You know, they don't pay very much for military. And the reason they don't pay much is they assume that we're going to protect them. That's not an assumption they can make because why are we protecting another country? Now I love the people of Canada. We have a great relationship. But if they became our 51st state be the greatest thing they could ever do, it'd be unbelievable. It would be a cherished state. And think of how beautiful that country would be without that artificial line running right through it. Somebody drew it many years ago with a ruler, just a line. You look at how beautiful that is. Wow. It would be very exciting. But if you look at Canada, and would be cherished as a 51st state, they don't pay their share of military. In NATO, they pay very little for military. They're not protected at all. And the reason is they think we're going to protect them. The other thing is we subsidize them to the tune of about $200 billion a year. If we stop doing that, if we stop allowing them to make cars through tariffs and other things, cars, trucks, et cetera, what they make, they're not viable as a country."}]}
{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "Would you agree that it's a more aggressive foreign policy than your first term?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "And why is that? It's more aggressive. It's better. Why? Because I think I've had a lot of experience, and in my first term, I was fighting everybody because they were very aggressive toward me. I always said survival and taking care of the country, not necessarily in that order, but I had to take care of the country. But I had a bunch of lunatics like Pelosi and all of these people, they fought me, fought me, fought me, and we won. And, you know, I had a lot of other things that were going on there. This time it's much more. They've lost their confidence. I think they've lost the respect of the American people with, you know, men participating in women's sports, with open borders with transgender, for everybody, for all the things that they're doing is so, so bad. When you allow people to empty their jails into your country, with prisoners, killers, their mental institutions and insane asylums into our country, this is what they're doing. When you allow gang members from Venezuela, but many other countries coming into our country, we're getting them all out now. They've lost their credibility, but they've also lost their confidence. So I have more time to do what I want to do. So we're making our country larger. We're making our country stronger. And in the case of Canada, if this should happen, I don't know how they can do it without us, because without the US Canada really doesn't have a country. They do almost all of their business with us. And if we say we want our cars to be made in Detroit with a stroke of a pen, I can do that. And other things in addition to that would not allow Canada to be a viable country."}]}

There's never been a group of people in this country, outside of maybe one instance that I can think of, but I won't get into it, that were treated more horribly than the people of J6.

I don't want U.S. steel being owned by a foreign country. They can have not. They're not. They don't have a controlling. They have an investment. All they're going to have is an investment. I don't mind. I don't mind an investment investment in a company, but especially US Steel. US Steel for 15 years was the greatest company in the world, the greatest, number one company in the world. And I'm not going to let another country buy it. We had a great meeting of that. But they are allowed to invest in it, and that's different."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Mr. President, on tariffs, sir, you've talked about reciprocal tariffs coming in this week.

Can you confirm that it won't affect everybody? Because there's somewhere we have similar tariffs, but the ones that are taking advantage of the United States, we're going to have a.

{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "For both. And on steel, sir, are you ruling out then Nippon steel having a 51% stake or higher? They won't have a majority stake."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Nobody can have a majority stake for US Steel. They can for other companies, but not for US Steel. I think you agree with that. US Steel was one of our great companies and through a lot of stupidity and bad government and also bad management of the company, it lost that luster. But it's going to gain it back. And tariffs are going to help. Tariffs are going to make it worse, successful again. And I think it is good management now. Yeah."}]}

And yeah, I think that it's a big mistake to allow people, the Palestinians or the people living in Gaza to go back yet another time. And we don't want Hamas going back. And think of it as a big real estate site. And the United States is going to own it and will slowly, very slowly, we're in no rush develop it. We're going to bring stability to the Middle east in a totally war torn part of the Middle East. A part of the Middle east that has caused tremendous problem, tremendous problem, the Gaza Strip. And we'll own It. It's totally demolished right now. It's a demolition site. It'll be reclaimed. It'll be leveled out, fixed up. There won't be anybody there. Hamas won't be there. We'll be building through other of the very rich countries in the Middle East. They'll be building some beautiful sites for the people, for the Palestinians to live in.

As far as us rebuilding it, we may give it to other states in the Middle east to build sections of it. Other people may do it through our auspices. But we're committed to owning it, taking it, and making sure that Hamas doesn't move back. There's nothing to move back into. The place is a demolition site. It'll be. The remainder will be demolished. Everything's demolished. I mean, you can't live in those buildings right now. They're very unsafe. But we'll will make it into a very good site for future development by somebody. We'll let other countries develop parts of it. It'll be beautiful. People can come from all over the world and live there. But we're going to take care of the Palestinians. We're going to make sure they live beautifully and in harmony and in peace, and that they're not murdered. This has been the most dangerous site anywhere in the world to live in. Hamas has been a disaster. And by the way, after tell you that I watched the hostages come back today and they look like Holocaust survivors. They were in horrible condition. They were emaciated. It looked like many years ago. The Holocaust survivors and I don't know how much longer we can take that. When I watch that, I know we have a deal where we're supposed to Get. They dribble in and keep dribbling in, but they are in really bad shape. They have been treated brutally, horribly. Even the ones that came out earlier, they were in a little bit better shape, but mentally, they were treated so badly. Who could. Who could take that? You know, at some point we're going to lose our patience. When I see that scene that I saw today with people coming out of helicopters and airplanes that are emaciated that look like they haven't had a meal in a month, no reason for that. And I don't know how much longer we can take it. I don't know how long we can take it. When I watch people that were healthy people a reasonably short number of years ago, and you look at them today, they look like they've aged 25 years. They. They literally look like the old pictures of Holocaust survivors. The same thing. I mean, the same thing. And I don't know how long we're going to take that."}]}

If they had a home that was safe, where you don't have Hamas threatening them, killing them, torturing them, they'd rather not return to Gaza. But right now, Gaza is the only alternative.

You've been reading about that with Treasuries, and that could be an interesting problem, because it could be that a lot of those things don't count.

You can see by the heading, it's fake, it's fraudulent, it's probably kickbacks, where they send the money and then it gets kicked back to the person that sent it.
