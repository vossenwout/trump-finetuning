They were allowing people to come in from prisons, as you know, and you've heard me say it, but you've heard a lot of people say it. Prisons, mental institutions, gang members, murderers. We had many murderers, 11,888. They think some murdered more than one person. So you had murderers coming in. You had everybody coming in, and not just South America, from all over the world. They were emptying their prisons into our country, and now it's totally closed down. And you've seen, just Yesterday they announced 99.9%. Nobody thought that could happen. And it Happened quickly, very quickly. And I think that's very significant. But we're doing other things that are very significant. Results will take a little bit longer because it's one of those, you know, it's complicated. It's many years of trading, abuse. We've been abused by other countries for years and years. They laughed at us. They thought we were stupid people. And we're fixing it. And I think that's going to be very, very important. But you have a lot of ground to cover.

We were losing a trillion and a half to $2 trillion a year. Not sustainable. They were taking advantage of us like they've never. I could have left it that way. And at some point there would have been an implosion like nobody's ever seen. But I said, no, we have to fix it. I've wanted to do this for many years. You know, I had the best economy during my first term. We had a tremendous economy, tremendous success. And we, we did tremendous numbers of tariffs on. We took in a lot of money from tariffs, China in particular, hundreds of billions of dollars in tariffs. We had no inflation, as you know. We had an incredible economy.

The. And then when Biden took over, it went through the roof. It went to the. Probably the worst inflation we've ever had. I mean, we had an inflation nightmare. Now, if you look at what's happening now, we're only there for 100 days, as you say, and in 100 days, we took over. We had bad inflation for four years, for two years of. Especially two years of his. His administration. I would say record setting like we've never seen. They say 48 years. The worst in 48 years. I say it was much worse than that. Right. So. So now if you look at what's happened, energy is down. Gasoline hit $1.98 in a few states during the last couple of days. It was $3.50 and $4 and $4.50. But gasoline is way down. When I took over, you remember the big thing with eggs? They hit me the first week. Eggs, Eggs, eggs. Like it was my fault. I said, I didn't cause this problem. This problem was caused by Biden.

And what they've done to the country is unbelievable. They've allowed 21 million people to pour into our country. Many of these people are criminals. They've allowed the. You mentioned Venezuela, the jails of Venezuela, to be emptied into the United States. You know, Venezuela crime is way down. Way, way down. You know why? Because their criminals are now living happily in the United States of America. And we're getting them out. And I was elected to get them out. And we're getting under the law, and we're getting them out fast, and we're getting them out illegally. Now, in some cases, we have judges. In some cases, they're radical left judges.

And I thought it was inappropriate, but I think the whole war is inappropriate. Again, it's a war that shouldn't have happened. This is a war that if the election weren't rigged, and it was totally rigged, the 2020 election, if it weren't rigged, you wouldn't have that. You wouldn't have had the embarrassment of Afghanistan.
