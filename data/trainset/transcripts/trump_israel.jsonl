I think the reason, the reason we're here is because Those pilots, those B2 pilots, did an unbelievable job. And you know, the fake news, like CNN in particular, they're trying to, you know, they're trying to say, well, I agree that it was destroyed, but maybe not that destroyed. You know what they're doing, they're really hurting great pilots that put their lives in the line. CNN is scum and so is Ms. Dnc. They're all. And frankly, the networks aren't much better. It's all fake news. But they should not have done that. Those pilots hit their targets. Those targets were obliterated and the pilots should be given credit. They're not after the pilots, are after me. They want to try and demeanor. Do you believe that Iran can rebuild its nuclear program? No, Iran will never rebuild its nuclear from there. Absolutely not. That place is under rock. That place is demolished. The B2 pilots did their job. They did it better than anybody could even imagine. They hit late in the evening, it was dark with no moon, and they hit that target with every one of those things. And that place is gone. But when I see CNN all night long, they're trying to say, well, maybe it wasn't really as demolished as we thought it was demolished. You take a look at the pinpricks and you see that place is gone. And I will say I think CNN ought to apologize to the pilots of the B2s. I think that. Ms. DNC ought to apologize. I think these guys really, these networks and these cable networks are real losers. You really are. You're real losers."}]}

So I'm not happy with them. I'm not happy with Iran either. But I'm really unhappy if Israel is going out this morning because the one rocket that didn't land, that was shot, perhaps by mistake, that didn't land, I'm not happy about that. You know what?
