TRUMP: You better hold your guy back, Vince, because he's going to have a hard time on April 1st. Let me tell you right now, he's going to have the hardest time he's ever had in the ring. And you know, Vince, when my man was last in the ring with you, he did a big number on you, Vince. You were scared, you were frightened. You didn't want to be in the ring with him. And I want to introduce him now. Vince, there's nothing for you to say. I want to introduce him. ECW World Champion Bobby Lashley, folks. We love you, Bobby.
INTERVIEWER: Back off, sonny. Back off.
TRUMP: Do we love Bobby? Do we love Bobby?
INTERVIEWER: You don't mind, Mr. Trump, let's go get on the business here and see how good you are at. At making this deal. You don't mind if I sign first, do you?
TRUMP: You sign first, Vince. Go ahead and sign first.
INTERVIEWER: There you go. Before you sign, I'd like for you to know one thing. This will probably be the last contract you sign with hair.
TRUMP: You know what, Vince? I doubt that. I doubt that very much. I think Bobby is gonna kick your guy's ass.
INTERVIEWER: So now then, there you go. The battle of the billionaires is on for WrestleMania. Donald Trump cannot get out of this deal.
TRUMP: I don't want to get out, Vince.
INTERVIEWER: And at WrestleMania.
TRUMP: Clip, clip, clip, clip.
INTERVIEWER: At Wrestlemania, Donald Trump. I'm going to do what everybody wanted to do. As a matter of fact, I'm going to do what all these celebrities want me to do. You know, here you are, show business mogul, and 95% of all the celebrities that we polled want me to win and shave your head bald. And that's a fact.
TRUMP: Well, you know, Vince, I don't know if you've seen the latest poll. I saw the other night, John Travolta, he prefers Trump. I see others prefer Trump. The poll shows 95% of the Hollywood celebrities want your head shaved. And we're going to do it, Vince. We're going to do it.
INTERVIEWER: You might have some support from this audience, but 95% of them are idiots.
TRUMP: To me, they look like a very smart group of people.
INTERVIEWER: You say this is one deal you can't get out of in WrestleMania.
TRUMP: I'll see you there, Vince. I'll see you there. It's going to be painful.
TRUMP: Say.
INTERVIEWER: In a sort of a roundabout, diplomatic way, is that Winnemaga beats Bobby Lashley and pins him. One, two, three. I'm gonna shave your head. And Austin's gonna shave your head bald. I'll see you at WrestleMania. Donald.
TRUMP: Hey, Vince. Hey, Vince. Hey, Vince. You listen to me, Vince. I've been watching you for the last couple of weeks. All over your office, all over this place, all over every arena in this country. You're showing me with my head shaved bald, Right? That's what you're doing. You're having a lot of fun, aren't you? Well, let me tell you what I did. I did a little number in you because I had something done with your head shaved. Balvins take a Look.
INTERVIEWER: Oh.
TRUMP: Not so pretty, Vince, is it, huh? That's what you're going to look like on April 1st, Vince. You're going to look just like that. April 1st, Vince.
INTERVIEWER: Man seems to be dispatching Umaga.
TRUMP: Bobby, I want you to do a number on them, baby. They say you're the best. I want them. I just want them to suffer. I want them to suffer, Bobby. Okay. Man.
INTERVIEWER: Look at that sight, Mr. McMahon. That could be before.
TRUMP: What are you saying to me, Vince? What are you saying? What are you saying, Vince? You want some? You want some? Come on up here. Come on up, Vince.
INTERVIEWER: Oh my God.
TRUMP: Want some? Let's go.
INTERVIEWER: Wait a minute.
TRUMP: Come on up, Vince. Come on.
INTERVIEWER: Here he comes.
TRUMP: You don't have it, Vince. You don't have it. You never had it. All right, Bobby, get out of the ring. Go ahead, Bobby, get out of the ring. You do your number on Omaga. Let me take this guy on. Go ahead, Bobby.
INTERVIEWER: This is not a board meeting.
TRUMP: Come on up, Vince. Come on up.
INTERVIEWER: This is not a negotiation. This is Donald Trump calling Vince McMahon back into the ring.
TRUMP: Get in the ring, Vince.
INTERVIEWER: Get in the ring
