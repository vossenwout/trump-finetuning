TRUMP: Come on, let's go out and do this real fast. We'll like it. This is the living room desk. Many presidents have sat behind this desk. Good stuff, right? We're just saying nothing, like the White House, you know, the whole. It's the whole deal. Right. How are you? Good to meet you. Okay. I'm always here. Thanks, Dan. All right.
INTERVIEWER: So we good to go here, Frankie? Should I wait for you? Your son's a big fan of our website.
TRUMP: He's a big fan of you.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, I've tried to get even before this started, I was trying to get a retweet out of him for about six months.
TRUMP: Well, we'll do that.
INTERVIEWER: He kept. Well, you got me. He won one, but he DMed me. I'd be like, get the old man and get a retweet and get the numbers up. We'll talk business.
TRUMP: Well, you're doing pretty well in that.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, so. Well, so are you. So I consider myself, believe it or not, apolitical. I don't consider myself wildly Republican, Democrat, down in the middle. In fact, this is my first interview I've ever done, so I started at the top.
TRUMP: You started very well. That's good.
INTERVIEWER: And I was going to give you the heads up. I don't know if you can remember this. You once were on Ali G show, and you were the only one that sniffed out that was a fake interview in the whole thing. I don't know if you remember that. I thought maybe you'd be like, oh, this guy's a fake. Now, were you.
TRUMP: Were you involved with that show? And so.
INTERVIEWER: No, not at all. I just watched it on TV.
TRUMP: But you're right. I was the only one.
INTERVIEWER: 30 seconds, in and out.
TRUMP: I said, hey, this guy's a total fraud. And I left.
INTERVIEWER: And everyone else sits there for six hours. I know.
TRUMP: The only one that's ever given me credit for that.
INTERVIEWER: That was a very sharp move because he's pretty. That he gets everybody now.
TRUMP: I like this interview. No matter what he does, I like this interview. Now, Mariano. That's right. I said, what. What's going on with this guy? And I just felt it was a phony deal.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah. And nobody else did it. Nobody else. Nobody else smelled it up.
TRUMP: He said he was some British Broadcasting Corporation. They called up with everything Beautiful. The Voice, this is British broadcast. And then this guy shows up. I said, this is. But within a version, like immediately. And thank you very much. You gave me credit on it because I never get credit for anything.
INTERVIEWER: I'm pretty good. That's what I'm saying.
TRUMP: I'm pretty good.
INTERVIEWER: And here's part of it, which. And I hate politics. My dad loves politics. The thing that drives me nuts is I feel like for us, which is good, they're like, hey, Dave, you're a snowflake. Hey, Dave, you're a conservative, like, crazy person. And almost on each side, you can predict what somebody's gonna say, which drives me nuts. It's like you put it in a box. So one of the things that I've been thinking about and for all the people like me, which is I think a good amount of the country's still like, which way am I gonna vote? One of the things that I have a question for, and again, I think it matters. I'm very curious on the answer. So when the Kaepernick thing started, I was critical of it. And as it's continued, baseball players now, I heard you say, if they kneel, you'll turn the game off. And we got the Black Lives Matter protests. So for me, it's like, how does somebody who's dissatisfied in your. In your world, what's the way for them to show it? Because we don't want them looting and doing all the stuff they're doing. To me, that's like a silent protest that is far better than, you know, going on the streets and crime. So I'm curious, what. What would you do if you had an issue with the country or something to show your displeasure?
TRUMP: Well, I mean, you can always say you run for office, right? You become successful, you can run for a lower office, you can do things. But there are ways you get groups together, and they could be very friendly ways of doing it, very successful. I mean, you're going to have rebounds, negative rebounds, if it keeps up the way it is. Like, as an example, Portland. This is crazy. 51 days, you know, we sent in very powerful, not military, but very strong people. The police are good, but they were told not to do anything, you know, by the radical left mayor. No, you have to go out and you have to say and speak. Your mind is good. I think speaking your mind is good, but you have to do it fairly. We are for justice, but we're for law and order. It's got to be law and order. And there is law and order. I put something out when they were starting to rip down statues. I went out, I found an old law, an old bill. You couldn't get it passed. Today you get 10 years in jail. 10 years and no games. And we have a lot of people in Jail. Right now, if you rip down a statue, a federal statue, because the states have to take care of their own, unfortunately, because I do that too. But you rip down a federal statute, you get 10 years in jail. Ten years, no, you know, three months. And nothing's happened since then. It was amazing. I signed it, I had a news conference. I said, if you do it. And we were supposed to have thousands of people march on Washington that day. Nobody showed up.
INTERVIEWER: How do we close the divide? Like, at my age, it's like. It just seems half the country hates the other half. And no matter what you say, you can't get along. So. And you're the lightning rod. There's no doubt about that in my mind. Do you agree with that? That you're like lightning rod sometimes for purpose?
TRUMP: I mean, you know, how do we.
INTERVIEWER: Bring it together so the two sides right now that are our heads can be like, you're my gu.
TRUMP: I think it was happening, and then we got hit by the China virus. Okay. I think it was happening. Success. Our country never did better. The highest, the best employment numbers in the history of our country. Best unemployment numbers. African American, Asian American, Hispanic American, everybody. Best unemployment numbers in history. Best stock market we've ever had. Although I must tell you, as you know probably very well, the stock market's almost at the same level right now, which is a good.
INTERVIEWER: I wasn't watching it today. That's why I went down today. I've been killing the stock market.
TRUMP: But the stock market has been absolutely great. A lot of things are happening. Great housing numbers the other day. Great, great, everything. We're doing really well. We're trying to get rid of the rest of this pandemic, but success does it. And we were ready to do it because if you look at when you say Hispanic or when you say African American, Asian American, they were all working. Everybody was making a lot of money. Everybody was doing good, and it was coming together. And then China sent us this horrible, bad present, a real bad present. They could have stopped it. They should have stopped it. And we made a deal, you know, we made a trade deal with China, and it was a great deal, but it means much less to me now than it did then because I'm not happy with what they've done to the world. They stopped it going into China from Wuhan, but they didn't stop it going into Europe, the United States and the rest of the world. So. But we were ready to do it. And the word is success. And I think we're going to have that I think we're going to have a great next year. We're going to have. I mean, you'll be able to see the results before the election, which is interesting, because at the very beginning of November, the election is November 3rd. At the beginning of November, the numbers are going to come out for the third quarter, and I predict those numbers are going to be really great. Despite the fact that Democrats want to keep their areas closed because they want the numbers to be right. I mean, can you imagine that's. You know, I know how you feel about that. And part of the reason. I think a big part of the reason they do it is for politics.
INTERVIEWER: I don't know that a Black Lives Matter person would be like, well, you know, the economy, great, but we still want the president to come out, whether it be Twitter, whatever, and be like, have our back. So that's where, like, the kneeling and things like that seems like such a small concession in the thing to be like, yep, Donald's our guy.
TRUMP: Yeah. I don't like the kneeling. I must be. I don't like the nail. I didn't like it for the NFL. I don't. I think there are many ways of showing you're unhappy, because when the NFL said what was happening. I know. Exactly. I know that. I've heard that, actually, but. And I don't know why he did. In the middle of the summer, all of a sudden, sitting in a T shirt in his basement, he came out with this thing about that nobody was even thinking about.
INTERVIEWER: He spiked. That's vintage Goodell. Nobody was talking about it. And he brought it back to the forefront.
TRUMP: I don't understand. He's talking in the middle of the summer. He comes out and he's sitting there, and he looked, you know, nice. But I wouldn't say like, Mariano, he looked nice in his T shirt. Okay. I don't know if I'd look much worse than that, to be honest with you. I wouldn't wear a T shirt. I think he would have looked better in a suit and tie.
INTERVIEWER: That's why your Twitter game's strong.
TRUMP: No, no. He would have looked better in a suit and tie. If I had. If I had any advice, number one, he could have waited till at least the fall. Right, right. But more importantly, I would have worn a suit.
INTERVIEWER: Yes.
TRUMP: Or a tie. Or even an open shirt that's loose, not tight.
INTERVIEWER: I got you.
TRUMP: Okay. So he came out with this thing, Dave. And everyone's saying, where did this come from now?
INTERVIEWER: Right.
TRUMP: And the whole big thing started, and he's Made a mistake.
INTERVIEWER: I actually have a question on your presidential powers. So you may not know this, but during the NFL draft, he said, I'm going to do a charity auction, and somebody can sit in my basement, watch Monday Night Football with me. And the charity will go to Covid. Well, I bid and won. I spent $250,000 to win that chart. I won it fair and square. You rejected it.
TRUMP: Well, he wanted no part of you.
INTERVIEWER: I know. So I don't know if you can arrest the guy for that.
TRUMP: No, but I think he did a good. That was a wise move by him. It's a very smart movie.
INTERVIEWER: That's the first nice thing we said about him.
TRUMP: Look, he's working hard and everything, but.
INTERVIEWER: It'S, you know, strange thing, history, human beings.
TRUMP: Well, he makes a lot of money.
INTERVIEWER: A lot of money for a job that a lot of people could do. All right, I have to ask this question because we followed. When you meet world leaders, you stick the handshake on him, and it looks like you're going for the power move. Is that intentional?
TRUMP: So before COVID right now.
INTERVIEWER: I guess right now you can't. This is pre Covid.
TRUMP: You know, he's the one. The only one I've shaken hands with in a long time. You. Because you stuck your hand out, and I'm saying, what are we doing? But I shook your hand. You were tested.
INTERVIEWER: I was tested when I came in here.
TRUMP: Otherwise, they'd take you out right now. They'll end the interview. Did you notice that he stuck his hand out? I say, what do I do here? Rather than insult him, I said, fine.
INTERVIEWER: I appreciate.
TRUMP: I mean, I immediately ran wash. But. But, no, but in the days from, like, four months ago. Yeah, I just, you know, I. People don't know that I get along really great with the world leaders. I'm tougher with the world leaders than any president's been. I've been tougher on Russia by far, with the pipeline, with our military, with the oil. You know, we're now the number one energy in the world, energy producer in the world. And there's nobody even close. I've been very tough with Russia. I've been very tough with. I mean, China. Nobody's been tough like me with China. And that's not to be tough. That's because for years, they've taken advantage of so many countries. Not those two. Only the whole world. Our allies, NATO. The whole world has taken advantage of our country. But despite that, I have a very good relationship with leaders. I mean, does the handshake I'll shake. I mean, I shake their hand. I hug them like this. No, I have a lot of great. Abi of Japan, you know, look, they've been ripping us off, off for years and years. They send the cars in. There's no tax. We send a car to them, they say, we don't take your cars. You know, this is the kind of thing that we've put up with. We defend these countries. We get nothing for it. And, you know, I've ended a lot of the craziness that's gone on.
INTERVIEWER: Do you love doing Twitter?
TRUMP: There are times when I love it.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: Too much sometimes, right?
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: Where's Dan? We have. I think we have.
INTERVIEWER: He's right there.
TRUMP: Dan. How many. What's our number now, total? Can you believe it?
INTERVIEWER: What happens to this Twitter account? Is it yours when it's over?
TRUMP: Do you lose it? It's mine, and I don't know if I'll ever use it again. But it certainly was good. It's a platform. Look, we have fake news. You don't know about that, but we have fake news out there.
INTERVIEWER: I very much know about that. That exists in my world as well.
TRUMP: And then, you know, Dave, that we. We have a. We have a voice. We have a very big voice. When you have the kind of numbers that we have, you're able to get the word out. And an honest word, and that's important. So it's been very important for me.
INTERVIEWER: Do you sometimes. Because. Follow you on Twitter, and I know I do this, but my. I'm not the pre. Well, my nickname is El President, but it's true. I'm a company, so we're doing it. Do you ever tweet out and be like, wake up. Oh, man, I wish I didn't send.
TRUMP: That one out often. Too often.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: You know, it used to be in the old days, before this, you'd write a letter and you'd say, this letter's really bad. You put it on your desk, and then you go back tomorrow and you say, oh, I'm glad I didn't send it. Right. But we don't do that with Twitter. Right. We put it out instantaneously. We feel great. And then you start getting phone calls. Did you really say this? I say, what's wrong with that? And you find a lot of things. You know what I find? It's not the tweets. It's the retweets that get you in trouble.
INTERVIEWER: You've been caught retweeting. People be like, oh, you just retweeted this crazy person, so you don't even look. You just press the retweet. Fire from the hip.
TRUMP: You see something that looks good and you don't investigate it, and you don't look at what's on the helmet exactly right. Which is in miniature, and you don't blow it up. And sometimes it's. But I have found almost. Almost always it's the retweets that get you in trouble.
INTERVIEWER: I've seen that a little bit with you. So we got opening day today. So Fauci's throwing out the first pitch. You give him any tips? You think he's going to be able to. I mean, he seems like a little guy. I've never seen him. You expect a good pitch here?
TRUMP: Well, they say he was a good basketball player. And he is a very.
INTERVIEWER: How tall is he?
TRUMP: Not. Well, he's not tall, but he was a fast little guard. And they say. They. No, they say he was a good basketball player. And he's actually a very nice guy. We don't always agree on everything. You know, he'd like to do things that I don't like to do, but ultimately I make the decision. But we make it all a group of people. And he's been here for like 45 years. For many, many years. And he's a nice man, actually.
INTERVIEWER: So I started doing. I'm a sports guy.
TRUMP: Good.
INTERVIEWER: Like company that bought us Penn national or gambling company. So sports gambling is a big part of what we do. I switched the stock market, actually, day trading. So Fauci is on my ex list because every time he talks and says the country should stay inside my stocks, like that aspect of it, he'd like.
TRUMP: To see it closed up for a couple of years. But that's okay because I'm president. So I say, well, I appreciate your opinion. Now give me another opinion. Somebody, please. Overrule.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, you overruled.
TRUMP: No. Well, you have to. And no, we're open and we're doing well. And I just had a press conference about opening the schools. You got to open the schools. They have a stronger immune system even than you have or I have.
INTERVIEWER: Well, that's not saying the kids.
TRUMP: That's not saying. But they do. They have it. It's amazing. You look at the percentage. It's a tiny percentage of 1%. And in that one case, I mean, I looked at a couple of cases if you have diabetes, if you have, you know, problems with something. But the kids are in great shape. So we want to open the schools and we're opening the country. And we had great numbers announced the other day. And two weeks ago, we had the best. The best. The biggest number of jobs we've ever had. And the month before that, we had the same thing. A lot of good things are happening, and I think it looks like a V. We have a lot of people that would like to see their states closed. I have a feeling on November 4th, they'll open them up. I think they want to do it for political reasons, but we're doing well. The polls are starting to really shape up. You know, Dave, we were doing great. We were sailing. George Washington would have had a hard time beating us. And then when the China virus came in, all of a sudden, you know, it's a dampener.
INTERVIEWER: It really is. It's a downer.
TRUMP: Well, it's a downer, though, you know, psychologically. And it went down. And now we're really starting to do well. We're looking really good in a lot of different places.
INTERVIEWER: I'm sure you've been asked this. It's one of the questions that I had when I was thinking what I would ask you here, because you. Theoretically, for somebody like me, who's sports, entertainment, having fun, you had the dream life, seemingly. And there's a part of me that's like, I wonder if he ever. And I know the answer's gonna be no. Regrets it. Because now, I mean, you're the most famous person in the world. My guess is nobody ever said, hey, I don't like Donald Trump before he came president, but now everyone has an opinion and your life has changed forever when seemingly you had the dream life beforehand.
TRUMP: I was in so many rap songs, like 79 or something. I was in every rap. This is before I did this. Right. It's a very interesting thing that you say, because the best day in my life in terms of business and life and everything was the day before I announced I'm running for president. Everything was good. The company was good. I was. I had finished up a lot of jobs that were very successful. It was. And then I said, I want to do this now. I'm really glad I did. But I was treated very unfairly with fake Russia. You know, Russia, Russia, Russia and Ukraine. Ukraine, all fake stuff. It's a very vicious business. Somebody said, who's the toughest in the world to deal with? Is it Russia? Is it China? Could it be North Korea? I said, no, the toughest is the United States. It's the toughest to deal with. When you look at what I have to do, I Have to focus on the big picture. But I also have to focus, have so many people on the left, or call them Democrats, call them whatever you want. And then you look at what they're doing with cities. Every city is run by a liberal Democrat, and they're going to hell. And we have to do something. We just sent people into Chicago, we sent people into Portland. As we said, we're sending people into New York to help out. It's incredible, but I love doing it. But there was this, you know, phony deal that I was devastated when I won because I couldn't have my life. I had a great life. I did one thing that happened. I was going into a thing called the Robin Hood Foundation. I'll never forget it. It was just about the night I announced or whatever, and my wife looked at me. She said, you know, I hear people booing. And she was with me for a long time. We've been together a long time. She said, some people are booing. I said, yeah, but some people are also clapping wildly. I said, no. She said, you know what? I've been with you a long time. I've never heard anyone boo you. This was right after I started being the politician. And it meant something because I said, you know, it's the first time in my life I was ever booed. You know the story, right? I'd go to Yankee Stadium. People go, I had a very. It was close to A. Who's 100%, but it was pretty close. And now I would say this. I have more fervor on the one side, and I have far more animosity on the other side.
INTERVIEWER: That's the vibe I get. And I have. This is my DNA, but I'm not president. I feel like so many interviews, they're always coming from an agenda, positive or negative. And what I notice, I think, is you come at you hard, you just come back harder. And that's a very different thing for the president. I mean, I'm the president of Barstool, but people say, is it presidential? Is it not? And you just do your thing and it wins. I wondered that, like, here's a hypothetical. If the perfect candidate, let's not say Republican Democrat, came along and said, if we make him president, this country is going to be prosperous, everyone's going to get along. Would you step aside?
TRUMP: I mean, I don't know that such a person exists.
INTERVIEWER: Probably not.
TRUMP: And I should say, yes, absolutely, I would. Okay, so let me say it that way, because that's a much more politically correct. Absolutely.
INTERVIEWER: You're not known to be politically correct.
TRUMP: Yeah, but it doesn't work that way because it just doesn't, unfortunately. But I really believe success. We were there, everybody was working. Everybody was just. Nobody's. Probably you. I don't know how you're doing now, but you were probably doing better four months ago.
INTERVIEWER: Well, I got in the stock market right when it went up, so.
TRUMP: Okay, well, you got in. You got it at the right time. But a lot of people that. The 401ks, I mean, they're doing phenomenally, but a lot of people sold stock, and now they're saying, I missed it. And I said to people, don't sell. Don't sell. Just don't sell. Because the foundation is so strong. Don't sell. But the people that really lost in terms of economic. Are the people that got out, the people that stayed in. They stayed with me. They're doing great. And we're almost at record highs.
INTERVIEWER: Okay. The last thing. I'm going to wrap this up and this. We asked for permission. You can say no if you want to do it. My dad and I have had debates forever. He's not the biggest fan of yours. What I want to do is kind of a prank. I just told. He doesn't know I'm even here. We've talked a lot. I want to call him, FaceTime him and just. He'd die if he saw that I was with him.
TRUMP: You can do it quickly, right?
INTERVIEWER: Yeah. Take two seconds. He knows it's coming. This is gonna be.
TRUMP: That's bad. That's too bad.
INTERVIEWER: No, this is gonna be absolutely great. Let me get the thing here. I have it. All set. This will take two seconds. Dad, this is gonna be.
TRUMP: Is he a good dad?
INTERVIEWER: He's a great dad. Good. All right, I'll put you on.
TRUMP: Don't worry about socially distancing.
INTERVIEWER: No, I'll be. I'll come from this. Hey, I got a question for you. What would you ask this guy?
Speaker C: Dad, I know Trista sent me something, so I'm not shocked.
INTERVIEWER: The goal is to shock. We've had a very good interview, and.
TRUMP: You have a very talented son. Good guy.
Speaker C: Really.
INTERVIEWER: That's all he's got.
Speaker C: I was wondering why you were pinning me down, Mr. President. He never calls me.
TRUMP: That's no good.
INTERVIEWER: There it is.
TRUMP: That's no good.
Speaker C: Heard from him unsolicited in a long time.
INTERVIEWER: Well, there you go. You just need a meeting with the president.
Speaker C: Going on, sir. I knew something was going on, and I'm not shocked. Although I didn't expect expect to see your face just now.
TRUMP: It's great to see you.
Speaker C: Can you get him to call me a little more?
TRUMP: I'm gonna put a lot of pressure on him. He'll call you today in a little while.
INTERVIEWER: Thank you. All right.
TRUMP: Thank you very much.
INTERVIEWER: All right.
TRUMP: Great to meet you.
INTERVIEWER: He handled that better than I thought he would. Thank you. Well, he got tipped off, so this must have been a leak. I don't know how. Yeah, I appreciate it. Thank you very. Oh, can't do it.
TRUMP: A great honor. A great honor.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, I almost did. Thank you very.
