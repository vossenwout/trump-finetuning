TRUMP: It's a psychological interview that you're doing. You're sort of being my psychiatrist. I've watched your show a lot over the years. People break down. Oh, they start crying in the show. I said, that's never happening to me.
INTERVIEWER: There's an addiction to revenge. Nobody would fault you. You say, it ends here, it ends with me. What do you say to yourself when the crowds aren't cheering? What is the hardest, darkest moment?
TRUMP: I don't think I've ever said this on air before.
INTERVIEWER: Last week, twelve jurors deliberated for two days and rendered a verdict, finding Donald Trump guilty on all 34 charges of falsifying business records, leading to an unprecedented felony conviction of not only a former president, but also the front runner nominee for the Republican Party. Donald Trump has professed his innocence and defiantly outside the courtroom called the trial a disgrace, rigged, and claimed the real verdict will happen when the presidential votes are counted. On November 5, I traveled to Mar a Lago to sit down one on one with President Trump for an unfiltered, no holds barred interview. And I promise you, no topic was off limits. But I don't endorse candidates, so I want to sit down with President Biden and Kennedy as well, because everybody needs to vote, and not just vote, but make informed votes.
TRUMP: It's an honor to be with you. Let me just say, it's great looking at that logo. I've seen that sucker a long time.
INTERVIEWER: You look well.
TRUMP: I feel good.
INTERVIEWER: Do you?
TRUMP: No pressure. It's nice to lead a life of no pressure whatsoever. Corruption surrounded by corrupt judges and corrupt politicians. Other than that, there's no pressure.
INTERVIEWER: You know, you and I talked the other night, and I work in trial sciences for a lot of my career. And so I have a particular interest in the dynamics of the trial setting. You're fighting this fight and standing up for the rights of due process and fighting against prosecutorial misconduct and prosecutorial abuse.
TRUMP: You know, it was interesting when you called the other day about doing an interview. A lot of people want to do interviews, and I don't just agree to them very easily, but I've always had great respect for you. I watch your show, some of the real good ones and some of the less intellectual ones, and that's okay, too. But it's always been, you've always been very special. And I knew that you were, in some form very much involved with trials, and I found it to be very interesting that you would take this up. It's a very important thing.
INTERVIEWER: Well, I wanted to, and I know that there was some news coming out of Georgia today. There was some news coming out of Florida today that they're stepping back from this. And very good news I called for the other day, and I don't know if you saw it, but on Merritt street media, where I now do my show, I called for President Biden to stop all of this now. And of course, a lot of people said, oh, he can't stop it. It's a state case. Well, okay, that's an explanation for stupid people. But for people that understand how this works behind the scenes and all, I say the same thing. They need to stop this. They need to stop pursuing you. Since you started your campaign in 2015 to run for office, there have been so many attempts to get you off the board even before you started your campaign. Then once you were in office, two impeachment opportunities. They changed the rules to try to make it high. Crimes and misdemeanors if there were business conflicts. And in this case, in this case never ends. It seems to be never ending. And that is a distraction to you. And, you know, I really wonder how that affects you. What do you say to yourself about that? Because it seems to never be ending.
TRUMP: It's a never ending thing. There's a term that I know you've heard many times. It's called Trump derangement syndrome, and nobody's ever seen anything like it. In one way, we drive them totally crazy because we're doing the right thing. You wonder, why would somebody want to have open borders where people are coming in from jails, prisons, where they're coming in from mental institutions? And as you know better than anyone else, they're coming in, they're releasing the people all over the world, not just South America, from mental institutions and jails and prisons. And they're terrorists coming in by the thousands. They're pouring into our country. And who would allow this? You know, it's common sense, not a conservative thing. If they would devote that same skill and talent to making America great again, it would really be a wonderful thing. But in the meantime, we're beating them. You know, you mentioned I got impeached twice, and I won twice very easily, very quickly. We had great support from the Republican Party. I have all these cases, cases all my life. I didn't have any problem. And all of a sudden, within a matter of months, I end up with four cases. Now, of course, it's from the White House and the Department of Justice. They totally control the state case. In fact, I'm not allowed to even be talking about certain aspects of it because I have a gag order. Think of it. I'm the republican nominee. I was the president, and I'm leading the current Democrat by a lot. And I have a gag order from a local judge who was appointed by the Democrat party. A local judge. He's a local person and he is appointed, and he put a gag on me. While you're at it, nobody's ever seen.
INTERVIEWER: Anything like it while you're campaigning.
TRUMP: Like you just mentioned a question that I'm not allowed to talk about.
INTERVIEWER: Right.
TRUMP: Can you imagine? I'm the republican nominee and I'm not allowed to talk because a local judge from New York appointed by Democrats said, I can't talk about it. It's so unfair. And then he gives a jury charge. Nobody's ever heard of a charge like this. He gave instructions to the jury. And by the way, the jury happened to be in a location that was almost no Republican. Do you understand that?
INTERVIEWER: Yeah. It was 80, 713 in the last two elections. Republican. And I know you can't talk about it. I'm not under a gag order. I do know that the number three person in the Department of Justice took a pay cut and went down in stature to go to a state job and become one of the lead prosecutors in this case. But yet they say, hey, Doctor Phil, why are you saying that President Biden needs to stop all of this? It's the state case. That's exactly why I'm saying it. Don't be naive. People understand that there's a power play going on here.
TRUMP: It's controlled by the White House and the DOJ, 100%.
INTERVIEWER: Gerard Baker wrote in Wall Street Journal today, and I'm paraphrasing, but he said, what do we say to those people that are rejoicing over reducing law to the status of a weapon in the hands of the dominant political power? Because that's what's happening right now. It's become a weapon, and that's not what it's intended for. That's not what we need to be doing. I mean, let's let the people decide these, right?
TRUMP: That's right. That was a very good statement in the Wall Street Journal. I read that this morning. And it's so true. I mean, it's so accurate. They've weaponized to a level they are trying to affect the election by demeaning, hurting in any form. And by the way, I think after the election, they'll still, the hatred's great enough that they'll go, but with much less enthusiasm. This is about November 5, which I think is going to be the most important day in the history of our country. If we don't turn this around, we're not going to have a country left anymore.
INTERVIEWER: Well, we're a country of laws, right? I mean, and that's what's made us so orderly. That's what's allowed us to progress forward. And there's something that are called Hornbook laws or black letter law that is just, these things have just been around so long, and these were violated in your case, one right after the other. For example, you don't let someone that has been charged in the same case as someone else, and they made a plea deal and said, okay, I'm guilty of doing this because they were intimidated into doing it. The lawyer in your case, we don't even need to speak his name. He bartered around out from under 65 years, looking at 65 years of imprisonment down to three years and two years on this case and a tax case. So went from 65 years down to five years in exchange for giving them testimony against you. That's not supposed to come in, but it did. Pecker making a deal, a non prosecution agreement, that's not supposed to come in, but it did. That got into the jury box. They got to hear all of that. And so they say, well, you know, if we're not down here for the reasons they're saying, then we need an alternative explanation, which they're not allowed to get because your expert witness that was going to come in and say, as a former chairman of the election commission was going to say, this was looked at. There's not any, there's no issues here. They didn't allow that person to talk to testify. And I'm looking at this saying, how is the jury supposed to solve this problem if they don't have all the pieces to the puzzle?
TRUMP: They wouldn't listen to him. They wouldn't talk to him. They didn't want to hear his testimony. They knew what he was going to say. He was going to say he was 100%. And very importantly, when they tell somebody, you're going to jail for 15 years unless you say bad things about this guy named Trump, okay? Now, in all fairness, we know a lot of great people, but you don't know too many that would say, I'm not going to do what they want. He goes up to somebody and they say, doctor Phil, you're going to jail for 15 million years unless you say bad things about Trump. And if you say the bad things, you're not going to jail. At all. In fact, we're going to make you a hero or you're going to go for three months or you're going to go for a short period of time. How many people are there that say, you know, I'm not going to do that? There have been people, and those are, in my opinion, these are great people. What they've done to people that work for me is incredible. Incredible. The threats, the taking of a gentleman who's been with me for years and telling me he's going to jail for 15 years, unless they say, and he went back to jail a second time, I guess they didn't want him to testify. I don't know what happened exactly. But the threats that they made to this man, they've destroyed his life. These are fascists. You know, these are really bad people, Phil. But who's going to do it? You're going to jail for 15 years or you're going to go for 30 days or 40 days or you're going to go for no time. But you have to say bad things about Trump.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah. And that's intimidation. And some of these people, you look at their age, you look at their health, and for some of it could be a death sentence. And so they make a deal. And, and that's what I talk about. That's what I mean when I say prosecutorial abuse. Did anyone ever approach you and try to get you to make a deal, drop out of the race, make a deal here, we'll leave you alone.
TRUMP: No, they didn't, but I believe they would if I would have offered that up. I don't think, I think they know me well enough. I think I really do. But, oh, if I didn't run as an example, I would have never had any of these lawsuits. How about I get prosecuted on a person that I have no idea who she is? I have no idea who she is. I have to pay $91 million. And that judge was just as bad, just as corrupt. A corrupt judge. I have to pay $91 million to a woman. I have no idea who she is. She wrote a book and she made a statement in the book. And you know, that case, that case is a disaster. And then you. But I have no idea who she is. And they said I did things. These people are corrupt and in some cases incompetent. But it's such an honor to have somebody like you see it and see it so clearly. And I knew that. I mean, I remember that years ago you were helping Oprah out, that she was sued and it was having a big impact on her.
INTERVIEWER: Mad cow.
TRUMP: And I thought it was great. And, you know, Oprah used to really like me. She was here many times. She loved my key lime pie. We have key lime pie. And she loved a lot of things about Mar a Lago and Roger King. As you know, we were here for.
INTERVIEWER: The funeral for Roger, correct.
TRUMP: Long time ago. It's the only funeral we've ever had at Mar a lago. I said, maybe we can do a new business here. We'll do operators, a funeral parlor. But it was one of the most beautiful funerals in the ballroom behind us. And he was a great guy, and Oprah's terrific. But once I announced I was running and I said, we have to have strong borders. We have to have this, we have to have that. We've sort of lost contact, as the expression goes. But I remember when you were very much involved in helping Oprah.
INTERVIEWER: Well, that's what I'm saying. It's been time and time again. And that was another black letter long that you just don't do. The judge tells you, okay, you can testify, but I'm going to allow them to ask you about this person that you now owe $91 million. I'm going to allow them to ask you about this other case. I'm going to allow them to ask you about ten contempt citations that I've given you. I'm going to allow them to ask about all that stuff. What does any of that have to do with the matters that have, and the answer is zero. That gets into the jury box. If you take the witness stand again, that is black letter law. You can't let in unrelated things that have more prejudicial impact than probative nature. That just doesn't happen. But it happened one, two, three things right in a row. And that gets into the judgment.
TRUMP: If you testify, they'll be able to ask you about all these different things. And by the way, if you say one thing, that's, if you say, it was a beautiful day, as I remember it, and it was raining out, we're going to indict you for perjury.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, yeah.
TRUMP: And I'll tell you what. I have a lot of lawyers that are friends and this and that. I had probably 25 guys over the course of a couple of months. Say, whatever you do, don't testify because you'll say something that's a little bit off, and you will be indicted for lying, for perjury. These are evil people. These are sick, evil people.
INTERVIEWER: I would have thrown myself in front of your car to keep you from testifying.
TRUMP: No, I know. I wanted to so badly. And by the way, I would have loved to have testified about those things because it was so corrupt and so horrible. But he wouldn't have allowed me to answer the questions properly. And so I would have loved to have testified. I wanted to. I'm telling you, they had to hold me back. But every lawyer that came to, they'd always start to say, by the way, I'm afraid of yours. Don't testify. And they saw what he was doing. They can ask you about, like, anything. They can do nothing to do with his case, all of these outside things. And it was really an unfair trial. There's a very brilliant judge in Florida that's holding the government. It looks like. I mean, she's looking into what happened because, you know, they raided Mar a Lago and they took stuff out by the satchel. I mean, they took bags and bags of stuff. And I said, what are they taking? Are they saying what they're taking? Because they can add things. They can add the nuclear codes in there. They say, hey, he had the nuclear codes. This was all stuff that, under the presidential Records act, I'm allowed to do. By the way, Biden was totally exonerated. Now, I'm not sure I want that kind of an exoneration. They basically said he's incompetent to stand trial, but he could be president. Think of that. He's not. He's not sharp enough. Got no memory, got no this, got no that he's incompetent. Basically, they're saying he can't stand trial due to incompetence, but he can run for president. What's going on? What are we missing here?
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, it makes everybody uncomfortable about that state of affairs. And what I was concerned about with everything that happened in this New York trial is one of the big myths, is that the burden of proof lies with the prosecution. That is the law. But I can tell you, after years and years and years of trial, the truth is that the jury sits there and says, hmm, I'm looking at all this. And if we're not down here for the reason they say we're down here, somebody needs to give me an alternative explanation of why we are down here. So if we're not down here because of what other prosecutors are telling us, then what's the alternative story? What's the alternative explanation? And when you get muzzled in the way that this judge muzzled this case, they're sitting there saying, what's the rest of the story, you're not allowed to testify because you're in jeopardy if you do. They let all of this other stuff in. It should never get into the jury box. And so the scales get tipped, and it gets very, very difficult to get even one juror because there's not an alternative story that if you could tell without being in peril, if you can tell without being intimidated, it would be a very different situation. The burden legally is on the prosecution.
TRUMP: But logically guilty of until proven innocent.
INTERVIEWER: That's exactly the truth.
TRUMP: I can tell you that's the truth with me.
INTERVIEWER: That's how it plays out. And I did a focus group about this when I did a show on this on Merritt street, and I had 250 people in, did a focus group, and I said, and overwhelmingly, the people were in your favor. But I found those that had questions, and I said, what is your question? They said, where there's smoke, there's fire. I didn't hear the other part of it.
TRUMP: I'm sitting here and you've asked me indirectly a couple of questions. They're so simple to answer. I'd love to hear. And yet, if I do, this guy's going to. He's willing to throw you in jail. Okay? This is an appointed judge, acting. He's an acting judge, appointed. And he's willing to throw you. And he's so conflicted. It's so sad. But, you know, you do things for your country. And I view it. I think if my country weren't involved, because people say the two questions, I get these questions from very tough guys like you, the biggest guys on Wall street, the people that you read about, you know, but they're tough. They're tough men and women. But I have the question asked often is number one. Number one question I get, how do you stand it? How do you do it? How do you get up in the morning and put your clothing on and go to work? I do get that because people don't envy it. And the other one I get is, will they do it again? Meaning, will they cheat? Will they do it again? Will it happen again?
INTERVIEWER: Well, I have a different question than that. How question. My question is why? I understand how. I know you got a thick skin. You're not one of those people that's afflicted with the need to be loved by strangers. I get that.
TRUMP: I think that's true.
INTERVIEWER: My question is not, how do you do it? My question is, why do you do it? Why do you? Let's face it. I mean, you're a billionaire. You got a great family. You're a very dedicated father. People may not see this in you a lot because you keep that kind of private. But my question to you is, why do you subject yourself to this?
TRUMP: So there's a movement in this country, it's called Maga, and Biden's always fighting it. We will stop Maga. Maga is make America great again. And we were doing, you know, I had an administration that was a tremendous success, even enemies. I mean, we had the greatest economy in history. We had the best job numbers in history. That's why I'm doing so well with the black and hispanic vote. They had the best job numbers they've ever had. We were doing things that were incredible. And I was going through Russia, Russia, Russia, hoax. I was going through the impeachment stuff, you know, all of that. And, you know, in one way I jokingly said, somebody said, can you imagine what he could have done? Because I had one of the most successful presidencies, and yet I was constantly fighting off the radical left lunatics. They are deranged. They are. It's like a derangement syndrome. But I actually said, you know, maybe in some ways I did better because I showed something. But maybe if I had too much time on my hands, it would have gone too far and the administration wouldn't have been as successful as it was. When you look at our job numbers, I rebuilt the military. Largest tax cuts ever. Largest tax cuts bigger than the Reagan.
INTERVIEWER: Tax cuts, but higher.
TRUMP: The largest regulation cuts ever.
INTERVIEWER: I'm staying with my why? Question. Because look at this. Everybody calls it inflation, but affordability. When we talk about gasoline. Under your administration, average 257 a gallon. Under Biden, 361 40% more under your administration. Homes average $320,000. Under the Biden administration, 31% more. $420,000 under your administration. Interest rates 3.8. Average. Under the Biden administration, 39% more at 5.3%. Okay, now let's look at the border. Under you average 1.7 million border crossings. Their official number is 6.4. That's from Homeland Security. It's actually about 13 million because I know, I've been to the border. I've talked to the border guards down there, Brandon Judd. I've talked to Jason Jones. I've talked to the people that actually know the numbers. They say it's between ten and 13 million. So my point is, when you look at the actual numbers, plus the things you just talked about, lower taxes, higher tax revenue, you look at that and you would say, my God, he should be running unopposed.
TRUMP: I mean, why these numbers just, I appreciate it, but, and these numbers are really, I don't know who. Many were very conservative. As an example, I had gasoline down to $1.87, not 257. It's now almost at $4. It's going to be at $5 very shortly. It's going way up.
INTERVIEWER: I took very conservative numbers so people couldn't argue.
TRUMP: Well, interest rates. I was at 2.6%. They have 3.8, and now they're at 9%, 10%, and you can't get money. So, you know, we did a great job. We did a great job.
INTERVIEWER: Okay, so here's the question. Most people look at this from the standpoint of they ask themselves the question, is my life better under this administration, or is it better under this administration? My quality of life, my ability to pay for my children's lunches, tennis shoes, getting them to the dentist, getting all of the different things that go to quality of life. And when we look at that, it's not even a close call. So why are people so energized against President Donald J. Trump?
TRUMP: Well, I think it's, to a certain extent, it's habit, not necessarily against me. I think Democrats vote out of habit. I'll give you an example. I was the best president for Israel ever. Golan Heights. All of the things I did for Israel, and yet I get less than 50% of the votes. It's shocking to me. And Biden's a disaster, and Obama was a disaster for Israel with the Iran nuclear deal that he approved, you know, which was basically a path toward nuclear weapons. And I say, why? And I say it's habit. They're used to voting for Democrats. Black people are used to voting for Democrats, but they're coming off it. They're smart. They're seeing what's happened. They're seeing criminal justice reform. They're seeing the black colleges and universities. I got it funded. They're seeing all of the things that I've done. Nobody could do what I did. I say that, and people sometimes smile, but it's actually true. I'm the best president for black people since Abraham Lincoln. And people, black people are seeing that. And we have numbers now that as a Republican, I don't think anybody's ever had. I hope they come out and vote for me.
INTERVIEWER: I was just in Jerusalem and interviewed Prime Minister Netanyahu. He said that the Abraham accords, which you achieved, he said he didn't have the words to describe what it presented for Israel in terms of security, in terms of the ability to bring about peace and stability to that region.
TRUMP: That's very nice, by the way. Did you say that? And by the way, great for the arab community also. It was great for both. And they're working so well. The only problem is we had four countries signed, real leaders. I would have had everybody signed up. I would have had Iran signed up. People laugh when I say that Iran was broke. I said, anybody buys from Iran, you cant do business with the US. Iran was broke. They were down to almost no money. They had no money to fund Hamas or Hezbollah. They had no money. They were broke. They would have made a deal within a week after the election. That result was very dangerous for our country. We did great things. And I think that's what people see. People want to go back to where we were.
INTERVIEWER: You had high level appointee positions that you didn't fill and thousands more mid level positions that you didn't fill and generated over $4 trillion in tax revenue for the first time ever. With tax cuts, lower tax rates, higher.
TRUMP: Tax revenues brought business into the country.
INTERVIEWER: So why are people so energized against you? Are you getting out messaged?
TRUMP: I think no, I really believe it's 100 years. As an example with African Americans. For 100 years, the Democrats have run the cities. 100 years. I used to say 50. They said, you're wrong. I said, you have to be kidding. It's 100 years. It's a habit. They get used to it. But they're learning that habit's being broken in a lot of different ways. I also think you have a fake news that doesn't report it the way they should be reporting it. Look, the news has been proven to be totally fake, and it's 95% on the other side. That's the thing I don't understand. Why would they. Why do people want open borders where millions of people have come into our country and you see what's happening to the crime rate. You know, a stat came out the other day that's scary. In Venezuela, Caracas, different cities, they've moved many of these criminals out into the United States. And now, happily, in a location near you, right near your house.
INTERVIEWER: Venezuela, the Congo, they're emptying their prisons.
TRUMP: The Congo, we have many, many people coming out of the prisons of the Congo. But the prison populations are way down all over the world. Nobody wants to talk about it. Prison population and mental institutions, something you deal with a lot. You know more about a mental institution than I do. That's your world. That's what you do better than anybody. As far as I'm concerned, you know, the population of mental institutions is way down because they've moved a lot of the most seriously ill people into our country. And Venezuela just announced that they're 72% down in crime from two years ago. Think of that, because they moved their, I mean, you don't have to be a genius to realize they move their prisoners out, but they move their gangs. All the gang members are now in the United States, happily living in the United States. The United States of America has become a dumping ground because of a very mentally deficient president. And it's not him. I don't believe it's him. I do think he knows what's going on. I think he's sort of an evil guy, but hes not at the top of his game. And he never was very good at it. If you look at his foreign policy for years and years and years, you look at how bad he was on the crime bill in the 1990s, how hes been bad at everything. And he got lucky. Look, he ran three or four times when he would be, lets say, in normal shape, in good shape. He failed. He got it when he shouldnt be here. He shouldnt be here. And hes dealing with President Xi, who I know very well, and he's dealing with Putin, who I know very well. And he's dealing with all of these leaders of these countries that doesn't, they don't like the United States. They don't like what it represents. And they are at the top of their game. They are vicious. They love their country or they want success. You know, you define it any way you want. We've become a failing nation. We're a nation that's in tremendous trouble. We have months ago, you know, where we have somebody negotiating for us and dealing for us who is not up to par. He's not, and I'm not even saying now, I think 25 years ago, he wasn't up to par. But he's dealing with President Xi of China. He's dealing with President Putin of Russia. He's dealing with Kim Jong un of North Korea. He's dealing with very tough people that really are at the top of their game. I know them all. I know many more than that. Our countries in tremendous danger of World War III, our countries. You look at what's going on with Ukraine now. You see what's happening, where they're talking about nuclear, they're bringing out the n word, as I say, and they're talking about nuclear weapons, and they're talking about things that were never in my White House. Nobody ever uttered the word nuclear. Nuclear is a very bad word because of the power of weaponry. And we have a man that should not be dealing, and we're going to end up in a nuclear war. We're going to end up in World War III with this guy. And if he. The five months is a long time. We have five months to go before the election. Now it's even a little bit less. It's getting to be, it's getting to be very close. Remember, you have early voting in September 22. You know, Pennsylvania goes September 22. So it's really less, quite a bit less. But I really believe it's a very dangerous time because I think they move. They're making moves. They love him as our president. They don't respect him. They think he's weak and incompetent. Now, one thing I'll say, he's surrounded by a lot of fascists and communists, but a lot of fascists. And they're young and they're smart, and that's who's running our country.
INTERVIEWER: Well, let me ask you something, Ian. Let's assume that you inherit a situation where american bombs are being used inside of Russia. Let's assume that you inherit that. We could wind up with World War three if we're not there already and it just hasn't been labeled yet.
TRUMP: We've never been so close to World War three as we are right now.
INTERVIEWER: Right. There could be 100,000 or more potential terrorists on american soil right now, today, given what's happened at the southern border.
TRUMP: Correct.
INTERVIEWER: And we do have Venezuela, Congo, others that are emptying their prisons of their most dangerous criminals with one caveat. We'll let you out, but you go to the United States.
TRUMP: I believe every country is doing it, by the way, if you were the head of a country, you'd be the first one to do it. I know you'd say, what? Let's get rid of these. You know, the money they save and the danger they save.
INTERVIEWER: And look at this map that I did a show about this. The red is where chinese government has funded buying major farmland. And then superimposed on that are some of our most strategic military bases. And you can see surrounding, there's Dugway, proving ground. That's military equipment, biological, chemical weapons. They're surrounding it. Utah test training range, the largest supersonic authorized restricted airspace in the United States. Whiteman Air Force base. B two. Spirit stealth bomber base, missile, drone operations. MQ nine, Reaper, global strike command three, Air Force, entire bomber force, nuclear command, control. And communications. Fort Liberty, airborne special operations forces, rapid deployment. We've allowed them to come in and buy up agricultural land, wind farms. No wind, no blades on some of the towers. But they're surrounding our military bases. We've allowed that to take place. You may come in and inherit all of this, and it may get worse over the next five months.
TRUMP: It will.
INTERVIEWER: What are you going to do about that?
TRUMP: Well, first of all, you mentioned a thing. Fort Liberty used to be Fort Bragg. We won world wars from Fort Bragg.
INTERVIEWER: Yes.
TRUMP: And they changed the name. And I don't even want to say that they spent $37 million in doing it because that's not the most important thing. But that's a lot of money.
INTERVIEWER: You know, it's pretty disgusting.
TRUMP: Now, I will say this. We want to let people come in and invest in our country at the same time. Of course, we want them to come and invest. We don't want to make it so impossible. We have to be careful. And this is a lot of land. What disturbs me as much, because we don't want to say, we're not going to let anyone come in and invest. That would be a bad thing.
INTERVIEWER: But they don't need to buy a round or.
TRUMP: No, they seem to be. There seems to be a lot of activity around those nuclear sites, to put it mildly. But the thing when you mentioned Fort Liberty, I remember that battle as soon as I got out. They changed it. But they changed many names, almost all of them. They changed the names of these forts where we won two world wars and plenty of other things. And, you know, there's a great anger about that.
INTERVIEWER: Well, as you know, they call it presentism. What they do is they take today's cultural standards and apply it to people's conduct 100 years ago as though 100 years ago they were supposed to predict what the standards were going to be 100 years in the future and behave the way things were going to be 100 years in the future. You can't do that. It's like you drive through a neighborhood when the speed limit is 20. Then they come and change it to ten and say, I'm going to give you a retroactive ticket. And that's what they're doing. They're holding these people to the standards of today's mores and folkways based on how they behaved back in that time. It's called presentism. And so they say, oh, no, we've got to take these statues down. We've got to change these names because they were behaving in ways that we wouldn't accept today. Well, but it was accepted back then. I'm not saying it's our brightest hour. I'm not saying it's our most shining time. But these people also did great things along with things that we may not be proud of today. But that's who they were at the time.
TRUMP: And it's never, if you know these people, because it's a group of people and they don't represent the big majority. Okay, they don't represent, but it's never good enough, no matter what you do.
INTERVIEWER: No. I call it tyranny of the fringe.
TRUMP: Yeah. It's never good enough. You could do all the name changes. All of a sudden, they'll find that's a problem.
INTERVIEWER: So in parts of a country, if you inherit this, if you inherit bombs in Russia and you have to deal with Putin, if you inherit terrorists on our soil, that could attack our energy grid, how do you deal with that?
TRUMP: I will deal with it, and I'll get the war in Ukraine settled and done by the time I get to office as president elect. I will get it done. As president elect, you have great power. I was able to do great deals from the time I got elected in 2016. I was able to do great deals from the time I got elected to the time I got to office in that little. Because you have great power there. You need the power of the presidency to do it. I'm going to get the war in Ukraine. If it's not done by that time now, it looks like it's getting worse. They're taking weapons now where they can shoot deep into Russia. Where is this going? Here's the problem with Ukraine, which is right next to, you know, we have an ocean in between. They're in for a tiny fraction of what we're in for, and I know them very well because I did it with NATO. I said, you people are delinquent. We're paying almost the entire cost of NATO. So they excuse the word. They screw us on trade, and then on top of that, we're supposed to defend them. And they said, it doesn't work that way. But I didn't want to do that. On my first, I let them know. My first, when I came back, I didn't want to do it. I was in office for, like, two weeks. But I said, you're not paying your way. And I went back the second time, and I said, you have to pay. Hundreds of billions of dollars was paid. They asked me one question. Will you defend us against Russia if we haven't paid? I said, absolutely. Not as soon as I said that. Oh, and I took a lot of heat from the fake news. The fake news went crazy when I said that because I said I won't defend them. Now you have the same thing. They paid hundreds of billions of dollars quickly, and that's where it got all the money to do what they're doing now. But remember this. So we are, we're probably in for $250 billion. You know, they just got 62 billion. And now I heard today that they need more money. It's going to never end. Now, you have some people that say it's not a war that should have ever been started. It would have never started if I was president. Putin would have never done it. First of all, energy went up so much that he makes money on it. You know, when you get up to $100 a barrel, I had it at $40 a barrel, Phil. It's so different. But it would have never happened. But now it has happened. You know, sometimes, I hate to say almost that it would never have happened and Israel would have never happened. The attack on October 7 would have never happened because Iran was broke. And Iran wasn't funding Hamas and they weren't funding any of the terrorists. Hezbollah, all of them. There's like 28 of them. They had no money. They were broke. I said to China, if you buy oil from Iran, you can't do business in the United States. They didn't want to take any chance of that. Everybody stopped. And we had, you know, we had no terrorist attacks. And I never wanted to talk about it when I was president because I didn't want to jinx it. I wanted to get up and say, we have had no terrorist. Think of it. During my four years, we had no terrorist attacks. This nation is in such danger right now with the people that you're just talking about coming in. And it was interesting because I saw 29,000 chinese people and they showed it on camera. They look very strong. They all have their propane stoves. They all have cell phones. They look like military people.
INTERVIEWER: Bill, a lot of military age men have.
TRUMP: Yeah, they're mostly men. And they're mostly of a perfect age for military. And it's almost like, what are they doing? Building a military organization within our country with our help. We have people running our country who are grossly incompetent, headed up by a president who should never be there.
INTERVIEWER: Bill, how do you unravel that?
TRUMP: Well, you have to do it with people, and we'll do it. Look, I have the same thoughts as you do. You know a lot of common sense to this stuff. It's not. We talked about it before, conservative, liberal, I don't care. It's common sense. We need borders. We need low taxes. We need good education. I rebuilt the entire military. The entire military was rebuilt. I built a wall that was so great, and I got Mexico to give us 28,000 soldiers while I was building the wall to keep people out. We didn't have what you have today. We had the lowest day the week that I left office, and it was a sad day for this country. The week that I left office. That's when we had our lowest illegal flow of immigrants coming into our country. And all Biden had to do was leave it in place. I had a thing called remain in Mexico. They had a remain in Mexico. How good is that? They had catch and release in Mexico. It was so stupidly run. And all Biden had to do. When he goes to the beach, you know, he's always in the beach, right? He thinks it looks good in the bathing suit. Some adviser said, go to the beach. You look great, Joe. And he can't even lift the chair, which weighs about 6oz. You know, those chairs that you can lift, they're meant for children and old people to lift. So Joe is in the sand and he's in the beach, and he's totally decimating everything that we built. We built the strongest border in the history of our country, and we're going to do it again. Just one little thing. In 2016, I got elected maybe because of the border, but that border was a fraction. It was nothing compared to what the border is today. And I fixed it. And, you know, in 2020, when I ran, I couldn't even talk about, nobody wanted to hear about the border because I fixed it. I'll fix it again. But the border today is many, many times worse than it was in 2016.
INTERVIEWER: Well, I've been to the border, and they just straight up say we're using tax dollars to send some of these children that are coming across the border into known prostitution rings, into sweatshops because we don't have the ability to check. They're just sending them all.
TRUMP: You know, we have 88,000 missing children. Now. Can you imagine if that were Trump? That had 88,000 missing children? 88,000. Thats a holocaust. Thats as bad as ive. I mean, think of it. These are young, very young children and also women. They take women and they trade women. And I had it brought down to the lowest level because I had a border that was actually strong bill and.
INTERVIEWER: Youre going to take it back to that.
TRUMP: Oh, were going to bring it back. And I think then some, you know one thing, and you know this better than anybody, that you got to know people. It's about people. If you put a great person at the head of a big agency, lots of good things happen in my business. If I have a good super in real estate superintendent running one of my buildings, and if I move them to another building, sometimes you move them to another building because, but then that building, you need good people. And we had a lot of great people. I had some that I was very disappointed in. I was some that I was very, very disappointed in. But the one thing is that I was in Washington 17 times in my entire life. I never stayed over. That was reported by the news. I was very rarely there. I wasn't a Washington. I was a New York person. I was a builder in New York, a real estate guy. I had a wonderful company. Everything was going good. It would have been so easy just to keep doing that. It was probably one of the, one of the most successful days of my life was the day before I announced I was running for president. Once you do this, the whole world changes. I even lost Oprah. Okay. Oprah liked me so much. And, you know, I haven't spoken to her, I think, since, but she's a good person. Please give her my regards. But, you know, you do things and my attitude is you have to do what's right. If I didn't think that I won the election by a lot, I would have never run. And I don't think I've ever said this on air before. Maybe I have. But losing the election wouldn't have been that, you know, somebody wins, somebody loses, you go on with your life. But when you lose an election that you know, you won by millions of votes, millions of votes. If I didn't think I won the election, I would have never done it a second because I would have lost. In other words, I would have lost. I ran because I won the election. And I know that that's what the people want. They want what you and I are talking about right now. They want strong borders and they want good education. They want all these things that we talked about, and we're going to get it to them. We're going to get it fast. Probably the hardest problem, the biggest problem is nuclear and the weaponry, and we have to keep out of wars and all that. But the hardest problem for our country is the millions and millions of people that have been brought into this country that have been dropped here. Many of them should not be here. They're really, really bad people from the jails, from the places. And you know what's going to happen? You'll take ten out and you'll have one where it's a woman with a couple of kids, and you're going to have the news say, oh, look at this. How horrible. How horrible. It's a very hard thing to do, but we have to have the largest deportation effort in the history of our country. Dwight Eisenhower had it very early on because he was one that wanted strong borders.
INTERVIEWER: But you're not against immigration?
TRUMP: No, I'm totally for it. But we need it. I think we need it desperately. But I don't want their prisoners, and I don't want their people from mental institutions, and I want people to come in legally. I want to let people come in. We need it. We do need it. We need people, but we need good people. We need people that aren't going to blow up our shopping centers and kill people.
INTERVIEWER: Let me ask you two areas I want to talk to you about. That's going to be different because I'm different. So let me be different. You have a personality driven platform just like I do. Mine's a fraction of yours. You've taken every shot you can imagine. You've been criticized, attacked, called every name in the book. They've turned the judicial system against you, the intelligence community. 51 intelligence officers swear that this is a russian plant, this laptop over here right before the election. The media has turned against you. Print, tv, radio, Internet, in the streets, not campaigning. Donald Trump, just real Donald Trump. How do you deal with that stress in your most private moments?
TRUMP: So two things. Number one, I don't like thinking about it. Out of sight, out of mind. I don't know if that makes sense to you. I don't want to think about it. Number two, I have tremendous support. I have the people support. I think if I didn't, I wouldn't be able to handle it so easily. When a judge who has conflicts like nobody's ever had wants to put me in jail, when he puts a gag order and says, if you talk about these things, we're going to put you in jail. I'm the republican candidate. I was president. I'm leading the Democrat by a lot, wants to put me in jail, I like not to think about it. It's like they say, oh, don't eat that food, don't eat this food, don't do this, don't do that. They don't really know, it might be good for you. It might not be bad, it might be good. They say it causes cancer. I say, don't talk to me about it. I don't want to hear the word. I don't want to. It's out of sight, out of mind. I think I have a very good disposition for trauma, but I have great support. Phil, the one thing is, because you mentioned lots of groups, and you write about that, but I also have great support within the media. You know, there's a group of people in the media, you might be one of them. You're a very important force. The fact is, I've watched you so long, I just felt so confident when you called. I said, you know, otherwise, what do I have to subject myself to it for? Does it make sense? But I find it to be a very different and very interesting. It's a psychological interview that you're doing, too. You're sort of being my psychiatrist, and maybe I could use a psychiatrist. No, it's pretty cool. But I try not to think about. I try not to go into that. And very importantly, I have tremendous support. I have support from the people. You look at the polls and they agree with me. There's sort of a silent majority. You know, it's a term that's been used over the years, but it's a true term. I have the support of many more people than they have. If we call they the bad guys. And I think if I didn't, or if I felt I didn't, I would not be quite the same person, you.
INTERVIEWER: Know, we all have a personal truth, you know? Is that what we believe about ourselves when we don't have our mask on, when we don't? You know, I put on a nice suit. You know, I'm going to see the president here.
TRUMP: Nice. Shit.
INTERVIEWER: I want to be credible.
TRUMP: Looks good.
INTERVIEWER: And we, you know, we put our best foot forward when we step out into the world. But we do have a personal truth that what we believe about ourselves, that our most vulnerable. When nobody's looking, nobody's listening, maybe it's 03:00 in the morning. We wake up looking at the ceiling thinking, what the hell am I doing? What do you say to yourselves when the crowds aren't cheering? When you're home alone, you're riding in the car, you're by yourself. What is the hardest, darkest moment that you can think of in this journey you've been on over the last several years?
TRUMP: You have to be very strong. You're fighting off very evil forces, and they're very smart forces. There are people that control Biden. Totally true. I think I know who they are largely, but there are people that control them. They're very smart, very energetic. Possibly they're real believers. You know what their sikh ideology is. But you have to be smart and you have to have confidence. I mean, you have to have a certain confidence. The other thing is, I realized over the years, I've been through a lot, great and bad. You know, I won the presidency. Everybody said, how are you going to do? How good is that? It was the most incredible evening that. One of the most incredible evenings in the history of the country. Look at the celebration. I mean, it was incredible. But you also go through bad. I also understand fully that the bad also disappears. In other words, you'll go through bad moments and it disappears. It's sort of funny, because I've watched your show a lot over the years. See, I'm not ashamed to say it because some people say, oh, you watch Doctor Phil. Well, you know, your show is a very smart show, and I've watched you ask a question similar to that to some couple or some, and they break down. Oh, they start crying on the show. I said, that's never happening to me. If that happens to me, that's the end of my political career. I think people actually, maybe people would like me better. But I'll tell you what, you need strength. You have to have strength. And people don't want to see that. I've watched so many people. You break down people and they don't even know they're being broken down. But it's different.
INTERVIEWER: Well, that's the last thing I want to do with you. But I do want people to know you. I want people to know every aspect of you, and I know it about myself. I know that not every time is a great day. Not every time is a hard day.
TRUMP: Until you led a charmed life, you never had a problem in your life, right?
INTERVIEWER: Yeah. I watched you during that trial. That's not a fun time.
TRUMP: You know, it was an icebox. That courtroom was so cold.
INTERVIEWER: Really?
TRUMP: And I believe it was set that way by the judge. That courtroom was freezing. You know, I'd call it the icebox, right? I'd say I just sat through, through 4 hours, and I'm not campaigning by doing that. That's what angered me. They're taking away my voice. They're keeping me in this icebox, and they're taking away my voice. But you know one thing, that's you bring it up and you haven't asked me the question yet, and I'm sure you will. Although I know we've been doing this for quite a while, and it's an honor to do it. But the hardest part for me is probably my family, because it's very unfair to my family. I have a very good wife. She reads this crap. I have great kids. You know what amazed me? I gave up my salary. I didn't take salary. And it's 450,000, approximately $450,000 a year. You know, it's still money. It's a couple of million bucks. I didn't. I never had a story, a good story, saying I did. I'm not looking for a story. What surprised me is there was a couple of stories. Who else did it? Nobody. Everybody took. I figured maybe Kennedy. It's a pretty rich family. I figured the only one that may have done it was George Washington. You know, George Washington was a very wealthy landowner. And they said the only one that may have done it is George Washington. I figured Roosevelt, maybe FDR. You know, there were some pretty rich presidents. Every president took their salary. Bushes took their salary. I didn't take my salary. I gave it up. And every month I'd get a call from the fake news. Because, you know, you can't really give it up. You have to give it to an organization within government. You're not allowed to actually give it. So what happens? You get the check and then you give it to health and human services, or you give it to the Navy or you give it to the army or something. And every month they say, did he give it? Did he give it? And when you show them that you gave it, there was no story. It was just interesting to see. The whole system is rigged. I mean, it's just a nasty system. But the saddest is, I'll give you one quick example. I have a son, Don. He's a good kid, and he wants to help people. And they said he was involved with Russia. He knows less about Russia than that young person sitting right over there who I'm sure knows nothing about Russia. And it was Adam Schiff. Adam Schiff, dashiff. A bad guy. And he comes out of a so called intelligence meeting, and he goes to a microphone. And there's a lot of press gathered because this was during the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax, total hoax. It had nothing to do. 5 million phone calls. I had. Not one phone call to Russia. It was a hoax. And it came out that way. And it's nice, but it took two and a half years. And by the way, it was very dangerous because at least Putin understood it was a hoax. You know, he used to say, what's he thought we were crazy. To be honest with you, he thought he was crazy. But, Don, so they say Adam Schiff comes out and says, donald Trump junior will go to jail because of what he's done with Russia. And it was Adam Schiff and Hillary Clinton and some others in the DNC that they made up a story. Think of how bad you have to be. You make up a phony story about Russia, Russia, Russia, the Russia hugs. You have the dossier. You have the whole thing. It's all fake. They paid $12 million or something for the dossier. 12 million. They gave this guy Steele a fortune to do a fake story. It's called the fake dossier. Right? They go to my son, they know it's fake. It's not like they're trying to. They think it's real. They know it's a fake because they made it up. And they say, donald Trump, Jews, we'll go to jail. So I call up my son. I said, are you okay? Is there something I don't know? How bad do you have to be when you can say about a story that you made up that you know is fake, that my son is going to go to jail because of this story?
INTERVIEWER: How do you deal with that as a father? Because I've had it happen to me. You've met Jordan.
TRUMP: Yes.
INTERVIEWER: And my other son, Jay. I've had stories about them, and it infuriates me.
TRUMP: I mean, I called him. I called him up. I knew it wasn't true. But I said, this guy, these are not stupid people. I call him watermelon head. He's got the thinnest neck I've ever seen, how it holds up that head. He's got a neck that's about a size six. Very unattractive guy, both inside and outside. And people say, oh, that's such a terrible thing to say. That's okay. Very unattractive guy. Here's the thing. These are bad people, and it's not easy to deal with, you know, when you have your kids involved or your family, your wife, and you read stuff, and most of it is untrue. It's just totally untrue. But think of that. They make up a story, and then they say, your son's going to jail for something that they know is false. These are bad people, Bill.
INTERVIEWER: Is that harder to take than when they're talking about you?
TRUMP: Yeah, for me. It is for me. I've become. I don't know. I've become different. Maybe it would have been tougher. I think the fact that I have so, such unbelievable support helps me a lot. It doesn't bother them.
INTERVIEWER: Has it bothered you? Has there been blowback on Barron because he's younger and more vulnerable?
TRUMP: It's not easy. And he's a great kid. He's a good student. He's got accepted to different colleges. Some of those colleges, all of a sudden they're riding all over the place, you know, you're saying, but he's a good boy. He's a tall boy.
INTERVIEWER: Very tall.
TRUMP: He's very tall. And he's a great kid. He's a good looking kid. And, you know, he's going to be going to college, but he doesn't say it. And I think he doesn't say it because he doesn't want to hurt me. And he thinks it's possibly a hurtful conversation, but it has to affect my family. And I think that's really unfair because I have a very good family. I have good kids. I have a wonderful wife. I mean, it's not easy for her to read this kind of stuff that's fake. That's fake stuff. And. But that's the way it is. It certainly is not a good thing. And, yeah, it affects me more than it would if it were just about me. I wish it could be just about me.
INTERVIEWER: How's she holding up through all of this?
TRUMP: I think good, but I don't think it's an easy thing for her. And I think if it wasn't good, she wouldn't want to tell me about it, to be honest with you, because, you know, she sees that I'm fine fighting like hell. I'm trying to become president and make America great again. That's what we're going to do. We're going to make America great again. They put tremendous obstacles in a way, including the 20 million people that are going to be in here by the time this guy gets out. It's an election we have to win. We're not going to have a country left if we don't win this election.
INTERVIEWER: Bill, have you ever thought that the toll that it takes on your family is too much?
TRUMP: Maybe not in the way you expressed. It's a very interesting way of expression, actually, of that question. I haven't really. I think to a certain extent, I think that my family wants me to do it. Our country's in trouble. We could be in a world war very soon. We could be. We're going to end the problem. Think of it. We're going to end Ukraine fast. I'm going to end it fast. I know both. I know Zelenskyy. I know Putin very well. I'm going to get it ended. That is a horror show that's going on over there. But think of it. Why are we hundreds of billions of dollars more money? Why is this happening? Why is Europe spending a fraction of the money that we're spending? There are so many different things about that that are just wrong. But my family's good. My family loves this country. And I think they feel that I do a good job. Look, we had the most successful country we've ever had during my time. We had the greatest economy in history of any country.
INTERVIEWER: Do they want you to run or do they tolerate you running?
TRUMP: An interesting question. Well, they tolerate it, but they at least tolerate it. Yeah, they tolerate it. I think they love the country. I think they think that I do a good job. I think they feel that. A lot of people say that this is, no, I get it so often, and, you know, I'm not sure it's right. They say there's nobody else that can straighten out this country. And again, Victor Orban said just recently, he's a strong man from a very interesting country, and he knows Russia very well. He knows Zelensky very well. He knows Ukraine. But he said the only one hungry, he said the only one that's going to straighten this out is Trump because he didn't use the word respect. He used the word they were afraid of him. I don't want to say that about these people, these other leaders. I don't want to say they were afraid. I'm not going to use that term, but let's use the word respect. They respected me. They respected me, and they respected our country. And they knew if they played games, I was going to hit the hell out of with tariffs and lots of other things. We have a lot of weapons, not just military weapons. I rebuilt our entire military, by the way. Our entire military was rebuilt. And this person that we have leading us, if you can call the word leading with quotes, he gave away $85 billion worth of brand new military equipment in Afghanistan. In my opinion, the lowest day in the history of our country. I think probably the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country was what happened the way we pulled out of Afghanistan. We left people behind. We had 13 soldiers who I met the parents. Theyre devastated, killed. Nobody ever talks about, you would talk about them. I put them right at the top, 38 soldiers who are no arms, no legs, faces, just wiped out. They're trying to live. Trying to live. Nobody ever talks about them. They talk about 13 dead, absolutely. But they don't talk about 38 soldiers that have been wiped out. And then hundreds of people were also killed. You know, hundreds of people with this madman set off a bomb. Should have never left them. They should have been in Bagram. We should have kept. Bagram is 1 hour away from where China makes its nuclear weapons. We gave it up. You know who's occupying Bagram right now? China. China. We gave the biggest air force base, one of the biggest runways, one of the most powerful runways, eight foot thick of concrete, built when the dollar was very big, okay? Years ago. We gave it to the Chinese. It should never happen, what we've done. I think that was the most embarrassing day. And I have to tell you, if that didn't happen, I don't know that Putin would have. And I think Putin watched that catastrophe, and he said, hey, this is a great time to attack Ukraine.
INTERVIEWER: You think it emboldened him?
TRUMP: I think so, yeah. I think so.
INTERVIEWER: Let me ask you this right now. Headlines everywhere, of course, you don't respect, but there are headlines out there that say when you win your second term, that you are going to make the people that have come after you pay retribution and revenge. And let me ask you this. Before you even respond to that, I want to play what if with you for a minute, what if when you win this election, you said, enough is enough. Too much is too much. This is a race to the bottom, and it stops here. It stops now. They've made a half a dozen or more major attempts to take you off the playing board, and you just said, it stops now. I am going to rise above this cycle of ugly. I'm not going to play this gotcha retribution game. It stops now. I'll forgive, I'll not ever forget. But I am not going to play this retribution game. I am going to put the american people first, not getting my pound of flesh first. You got to do what you got to do, but I'm going to put this country as the shining city on the hill. I am moving forward. I'm not playing the retribution game. It stops with me. It stops here. What? Have you took that approach?
TRUMP: I'm okay with that. I am. I'm okay with that. Sometimes I'm sure in certain moments, I wouldn't be. You know, when you go through what I've been through, they spy to my campaign. You know, they spy to my campaign. Remember I announced it. They did things that people don't even talk about. And I got rid of Comey and I got rid of a lot of people. I got rid of a lot of people, thousands of people at the VA. I got, I cleaned it. 9000 people. They were sadists. I got rid of them. But what they've done is bad. With all of that being said, we have to unite the country, Phil. The country has to be united. This country is a mess.
INTERVIEWER: Every situation needs a hero. What a great opportunity for you to stop this cycle, this vicious cycle of gotcha, gotcha back. Gotcha, gotcha back. Every situation needs a hero. What a great opportunity to step up and say, you know what? It stops here. It stops with me.
TRUMP: I think you'll be impressed. We have to unite the country. We have to save the country. That's not really saving the country. There are people that did some bad things. I know who they are and all of that. But as an example with Hillary Clinton, I'd say I've mentioned her name. Everyone's screaming, thousands and thousands. We just had 107,000 people show up in New Jersey. You saw that. 25,000 people showed up in the South Bronx.
INTERVIEWER: In the South Bronx.
TRUMP: But we had Wildwood, New Jersey. 107,000 people is a record. They've never had that. When I mention the name Hillary, previous to the last election, they said, lock her up, lock her up, lock her up. But I would be there and I turned almost quiet. They were going crazy. How would it be? I win and I lock Hillary Clinton up? The president's wife, the former president's wife. I locked her up. And how would it be if I took the secretary of state? She was secretary of state and we threw her into a prison someplace. I think it was terrible. And yet now they're trying to do that with me. Think of it. I didn't want to do that. I could have done that pretty easily. She busted up her phones and she busted up her laptops. And what they did, and they put bleach bit. You know what bleach bit is? It's so expensive, nobody uses it because it's an acid and it wipes everything out. Could have done it really easy. Don't forget, she disobeyed a subpoena from the United States Congress and she broke up all this machinery, all this technology after she got the subpoena. Think of it. How would it look if I took a president of the United States wife and threw her into a prison? I hated it because I wanted to bring the country together. And I largely did, and I brought it together through success because it was the most successful economy in the history of our country. Okay? Now, the difference is they're trying to do it to me. And maybe you could feel differently about it, but I don't feel differently. Retribution is going to be through success. We're going to make it very successful. We have to bring the country together.
INTERVIEWER: And you can do that, you know, because let me tell you, this revenge thing is there's a lot of research, and Doctor James Kimmel at Yale has done this research and seen neurologically in the brain that there's an addiction to revenge, just like, to opioid, whatever. And that even if people commit a crime and they get arrested for it, they see themselves as the victim, and they want revenge against the person that arrested them. And then the person that arrested them gets hammered. So now that person says, okay, well, I'm not going to put up with that. So they go back after the criminal. Now the criminal has been victimized again. And so we get into this loop where we're addicted to it back and forth. It's got to stop. And you're, we're better than this. We must be better than this. And you're big enough to do it. Every situation needs a hero. You can stop this. You say, well, I think it ends here. It ends with me.
TRUMP: I think you'll be proud of the job we do. And you know, the word revenge is a very strong word, but maybe we have revenge through success. But that's what I'd like to see. I want to see the country survive, because this country is not going to survive like this. And really, you know the expression, I think it's the greatest theme ever in politics, maybe because it's the biggest movement. We want to make America great again, and that's what we have to do. And I think you'll be very proud of the job we do.
INTERVIEWER: You know, the pope has a book out that he's written, and he says, we are all brothers and sisters, and there must be no resentment among us for any war to truly end. Forgiveness is necessary. Otherwise, what will follow is not justice, but revenge. And that's true even in the cultural wars that we're fighting here. I think you have so much to do, you don't have time to get even. You only have time to get right.
TRUMP: Well, revenge does take time. I will say that it does. And sometimes revenge can be justified, Phil, I have to be honest. Sometimes it can.
INTERVIEWER: But is the country better or worse for them? Going after you.
TRUMP: I think the country is really worse for what they've done. And I think you see that when you look at the poll numbers, when you see that almost $400 million has poured in since this horrible decision was made. That was a few days ago. Numbers that nobody's ever heard of in politics before. It's a great honor. The people of our country get it. You know, they're very smart. Taken as a whole, I have to say, they're very smart. But it's been an honor being with you. It really has. And I think you'd be very proud of the job we do.
INTERVIEWER: You have rallied people. I had people in my focus group the other night that said, I have not voted for Trump before. I have not been a Trump fan before, but I have donated to Trump because he has inspired me. I have donated to him and I am voting for him now and I have not before, but he has inspired me, actually.
TRUMP: It's been a beautiful thing to watch.
INTERVIEWER: Thank you, mister president. It's been an honor speaking with you. Thank you so much.
TRUMP: Thank you.
