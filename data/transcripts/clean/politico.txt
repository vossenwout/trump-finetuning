INTERVIEWER: Consumer confidence at a 17-year high.
TRUMP: Can you believe it? Isn’t that nice. There’s good reason for it, too, and I think we’re doing pretty well on health care. We’ll see.
INTERVIEWER: What have you been doing, INTERVIEWERPresident, sort of behind the scenes?
TRUMP: A lot. A lot.
INTERVIEWER: I mean, what do you think the crucial conversations have been?
TRUMP: Many conversations. I just had one with a certain senator that was very convincing to that senator. So I’ve done a lot. I mean, last night — last night it was amazing. I was at the — you know, I was in West Virginia doing certain things and making a speech to the Boy Scouts, and that was some crowd. That was an incredible crowd. But I’ve been working hard, trying to get the senators to go along with it. And I — you know, I think I — you know, look, just don’t quote me on this unless it happens, but I think we have a pretty good shot. 
INTERVIEWER: If you get the vote — if you get the vote today to go ahead, what will be the next hurdle that you —
TRUMP: Well, then you have to go and decide on what plan you want, which way you’re going to go. You want to decide on is it repeal or repeal and replace. If it’s repeal and replace, which one do you want to go? Which form of existing conditions? I mean, there’s many things. But once you’re in there, then you can really negotiate. This is actually the heart, though. Once you’re there, you can, you know, Gerard — oh, say hello.
INTERVIEWER: The partisanship, you mean?
TRUMP: You think — yeah, the partisanship. So, anyway. So I’d rather see — I’d rather see replace. I’d rather add the replace. And we have a very good plan. That’s the one thing, we really have a good plan. We’ve covered a lot of territory. It’s a very, very difficult situation because you move a little bit to the left and you lose four guys, you move a little bit to the right all of a sudden you have a bloc of people that are gone. You have about a one-inch road and it wheels through the middle of the valley, and if it’s even slightly off. It’s a very difficult – it’s a very difficult thing, always has been.
INTERVIEWER: Why are you so confident that you can get it done?
TRUMP: Because people were saying, Trump has not produced. I honestly believe for six months I have done more than just about any president when you look at all of the bills that were passed, 42, 43.
INTERVIEWER: What are you most proud of in the first six months?
TRUMP: A lot of things. I think I’m proud of the Supreme Court choice. And that’s not just a nomination, that’s getting him through. I’m very proud of opening up regulations. One of the reasons you see optimism is because people can actually use their land. They can farm their land. I’ve had tremendous and tremendous — look, I had 45,000 people there yesterday. It’s the biggest crowd they’ve ever had, and they were — they were going wild yesterday in West Virginia. But people can actually use their land and they can build.
INTERVIEWER: What about your disappointments? Any disappointments in the first six months?
TRUMP: Well, I’d have to let you know. I have to see where we are with this. Let’s see. Maybe it doesn’t work, but I think it’s going to. And, you know, it is — it would have been easier to start with taxes, but this is better if it works, OK? If it works, this is better.
INTERVIEWER: More general — generally.
TRUMP: But I think, you know, depending — so if you asked me that question in a month or really at the end of the year, because we hope to get this. We hope to get taxes and then infrastructure. And then I’m going to do a very big — we’re doing very big trade deals, and we’re looking forward to that. But we want to do, ideally, this first.
You know, a lot of people said you should have started with taxes or you should have started with infrastructure. Well, infrastructure, I’ll actually have bipartisan support, and I can use infrastructure to carry other things along. So I don’t want to waste it at the beginning, if that makes sense.
INTERVIEWER: When you say the Democrats are obstructionists, habitow tough a road is it going to be?
TRUMP: Well, they tried — they tried it with me. She spent hundreds of millions of dollars on negative ads. She didn’t do a positive ad, virtually. And she lost easily, you know, 306 to 223 I think, right – 223, something like that. ...
I mean, honestly, they — the ads were coming at me. Hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of negative ads. And when people went into the voter booth, they didn’t know what she stood for. I always said that. I said if I can take this onslaught personally, it’s going to be a great thing because nobody knew what she stood for. So now, they’re trying to change their message a little bit, you know. I mean, it’s — it’s one of those things, but now they’re trying to change their message and we’ll see what happens.
But I think that we’re doing very well. Every indication is that in every one of our swing states we’re substantially up, like Ohio. Tonight I’m going to Ohio — Youngstown, Ohio — and we’ll be up — we’re way up. You know, I won the state by 9 or 10 or something, by 9 or 10 points, without any governor support, OK? So you have the governor of Ohio not supporting you and you win by almost 10 points, which is pretty good because Ohio’s not — if you remember, you guys were always saying you have to win Ohio, right?
INTERVIEWER: No Republican has ever won the presidency without winning Ohio.
TRUMP: No, right, no, it’s — it was — and we won, you know, by a landslide.
INTERVIEWER: We were in West Virginia yesterday.
TRUMP: Oh, you did? Was that a scene, though? Huh?
INTERVIEWER: That was a scene, yes. (Laughter.)
TRUMP: Biggest crowd they’ve ever had. What did you think?
INTERVIEWER: I thought it was an interesting speech in the context of the Boy Scouts.
TRUMP: Right.
INTERVIEWER: They seemed to get a lot of feedback from former scouts and –
TRUMP: Did they like it?
INTERVIEWER: It seemed mixed.
TRUMP: They loved it. [Laughter.] It wasn’t — it was no mix. That was a standing –
INTERVIEWER: In the — you got a good — you got a good reaction in –
TRUMP: I mean, you know, he writes mostly negative stuff. But that was a standing ovation –
INTERVIEWER: You got a good reaction inside the arena, that’s right.
TRUMP: ... from the time I walked out on the stage — because I know. And by the way, I’d be the first to admit mixed. I’m a guy that will tell you mixed. There was no mix there. That was a standing ovation from the time I walked out to the time I left, and for five minutes after I had already gone. There was no mix.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, there was a lot of supporters in the arena.
TRUMP: And I got a call from the head of the Boy Scouts saying it was the greatest speech that was ever made to them, and they were very thankful. So there was — there was no mix.
INTERVIEWER: Sir, can I ask you about taxes?
TRUMP: Yes.
INTERVIEWER: So, you know, we’re awaiting the outcome of health, we’ll get a vote. I know you want to get tax reform done. Gary, you talked about it.
TRUMP: Yes, very much. Very important.
INTERVIEWER: So can – what’s – I mean, you’ve outlined the principles of tax reform. Can you tell us what you – you know, what you want to achieve fundamentally in tax reform?
TRUMP: Sure. I want to –
INTERVIEWER: What are the main goals?
TRUMP: I want to achieve growth. We’re the highest-taxed nation in the world, essentially, you know, of the size. But we’re the highest-taxed nation in the world. We have — nobody knows what the number is. I mean, it used to be, when we talked during the debate, $2.5 trillion, right, when the most elegant person — right? I call him INTERVIEWERElegant. I mean, that was a great debate. We did such a great job. But at that time I was talking $2.5 trillion. I guess it’s $5 trillion now. Whatever it is, it’s a lot more. So we have anywhere from 4 [trillion] to 5 or even more trillions of dollars sitting offshore.
We want to get that back, No. One, at a very reasonable cost. And that cost is going to be 10 percent. And right now, it’s so high that, No. One: You would never do it on a business basis. But, No. Two: Bureaucratically it’s impossible. Did you know that? I have friends that try and get their money back. They say they have to go through years of writing out forms and this and that to bring money back into the country. We’re going to make that one — like a half-a-page document. It’s going to be very easy to bring your money back in. And it’s going to be taxed at 10 percent, which is a rate that’s — it’s within reason. And so that’s one of the things we want to do. That’ll be an easy one. That’s one that — you know, it’s — when you talk about a country that’s broken or a system that’s broken, there’s something — the $5 trillion, let’s call it — that the Democrats and the Republicans agree should come back in. It’s been out there for years. Nobody ever did anything about it. I mean, Obama ...
INTERVIEWER: Right. But a 10 percent corporate rate, that’s ...
TRUMP: Ten percent.
INTERVIEWER: Ten percent repatriation.
INTERVIEWER: Repatriation rate.
INTERVIEWER: A repatriation rate. A 10 percent repatriation rate.
INTERVIEWER: What do you think is a reasonable corporate rate? We’ve heard 20 percent, but —
TRUMP: Well, you know, we’re going for 15 percent. We’re going to see, and we’ll see. But, you know, I don’t want to say anything about negotiation. I mean, we are asking for 15 percent, and we think we’re going to grow tremendously.
TRUMP: Right. Yeah, that’s – we don’t want –
INTERVIEWER: And that’s still the aim? That’s still very much the aim?
TRUMP: So I shouldn’t say it with everybody in the room, especially Gary, but – (laughter) – this is –
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, let’s all worry about me.
TRUMP: The truth is the people I care most about are the middle-income people in this country who have gotten screwed. And this upward revision, it’s going to be on high-income people.
You know, I was with Bob Kraft the other night. He came to have dinner with me. He’s a friend of mine. And as he left, he said, Donald, don’t worry about the rich people. Tax the rich people. You got to take care of the people in the country. It was a very interesting statement. I feel the same way.
INTERVIEWER: Well, Gary’s a middle-income – (inaudible). (Laughter.) He works for the White House. He’s on a –
TRUMP: He had to pay 200 million (dollars) in tax, Gary. Gary wrote a check for 200 (million dollars).
(Cross talk.)
INTERVIEWER: There was some focus – Steve Bannon was saying that maybe you want a higher income tax than the 40 percent, you know, that you might be –
TRUMP: No, that was not right. That was not a correct statement, no.
INTERVIEWER: That was not a – that was not a correct –
INTERVIEWER: OK. OK.
TRUMP: We want – look, the job producers we’re going to take great care of, but we have to take care of middle-income people in this country. They built the country, they started this whole beautiful thing that we have, and we have to take care of them. And people have not taken care of them, and we’re going to.
And I mean, I have wealthy friends that say to me I don’t mind paying more tax. And I’ll tell you what I sort of don’t like, is when they – you know, you’ll do your charts in The Wall Street Journal and they’ll be brilliantly done, very nice, and they’ll show that a rich guy who made, you know, $25 million last year is going to pay less than he was. In a certain way, I don’t like that. I’d rather take that difference and put it into the middle-income and put it into corporate.
INTERVIEWER: You should be able to get Democrat support for that, right? I mean, you can reach across the aisle –
TRUMP: Yeah, except they’re obstructionists. If they weren’t obstructionists, I would normally get Democratic support. So we don’t anticipate that. We don’t –
INTERVIEWER: How would you rate your chances of being able to make those permanent as opposed to temporary?
TRUMP: Well, do you mean 10 years versus? So it hasn’t really come up. I mean, the last time it was 10 years. When George Steinbrenner died, like with the estate taxes, the estate paid nothing. And if he would have died like two weeks later, they would have paid 50 percent of the Yankees. That would have been the end of the team, right? He had very fine tax planners. But it hasn’t come up. We’d like –
INTERVIEWER: Or doctors. (Laughter.)
TRUMP: We would like to make them permanent, but I assume you’re talking about like a –
INTERVIEWER: So if it balances in the 10-year window, it’s permanent. The only way you have to end the tax plan is at the end of 10 years if it creates a deficit. We are working towards a plan that is permanent. To get the capital investment that the president wants – and that’s how you create jobs, and that’s how you create economic growth – businesses have to know it’s a permanent tax change. So that is our objective.
INTERVIEWER: Does that – [inaudible] – for businesses?
INTERVIEWER: We think – we’ve spent an enormous amount of time working as a group to make sure that we get permanent tax change, simplification, and lower rates.
TRUMP: We think we’re going to have tremendous growth. We think money’s going to come pouring into the country.
Look, we’re losing companies. People don’t even realize how bad it is, but we’re losing companies every single day where they’re leaving because the taxes are too high. When we do this, we’ll have companies – I know companies that have left. They go to Ireland, they go to other – I own a lot of property in Ireland. They go to Ireland because of these incredible tax rates, and other places, right? We’ll have companies pouring back into our nation. I mean, it’s going to be – you know, it’s going to be beautiful.
INTERVIEWER: While we’re on the economy, can I ask you, we’re coming up very soon to the time to decide whether or not to reappoint Janet Yellen as the –
TRUMP: Yes.
INTERVIEWER: – chair of the Federal Reserve or to appoint somebody else. Are you – have you reached a decision?
TRUMP: I have a lot of respect for her, and I like her. I’ve met her just a couple of times, but I like her. It’s early to make the decision. She doesn’t come up until February/March?
INTERVIEWER: End of June.
INTERVIEWER: February. February 1st is –
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, yeah.
TRUMP: No, I have a lot of respect for her. I like her. She is –
INTERVIEWER: Does that mean it’s possible you would keep her?
TRUMP: I do like low interest rates. I mean, you know, I’m not making that a big secret. I think low interest rates are good. I like a dollar that’s not too strong. I mean, I’ve seen strong dollars. And frankly, other than the fact that it sounds good, lots of bad things happen with a strong dollar.
INTERVIEWER: So she’s definitely – she’s definitely in the running to be replaced this time?
TRUMP: I would say – you mean to stay?
INTERVIEWER: To stay.
TRUMP: I would say yes, she is in the running to stay.
INTERVIEWER: Is Gary a candidate? (Laughter.)
TRUMP: He doesn’t know this, but yes, he is. (Laughter.)
INTERVIEWER: Are there other candidates?
TRUMP: I actually think he likes what he’s doing right now.
INTERVIEWER: That’s what he tells us.
TRUMP: Don’t tell Gary what I just said.
INTERVIEWER: Are there other candidates?
TRUMP: Yeah, there are two or three. But she is – she is in the running, absolutely. I like her. I like her demeanor. I think she’s done a good job. I’d like to see rates stay low. She’s always been – you know, she’s historically been a low-interest-rate person, a believer.
INTERVIEWER: Do you have a time frame for announcing a decision?
TRUMP: I would say sometime by the end of year, probably.
INTERVIEWER: So you’re going to wait till it’s pretty –
TRUMP: I think so.
INTERVIEWER: So you’re not –
INTERVIEWER: It would need a confirmation process, which will take time.
TRUMP: Yeah, but it’ll go quickly. We’re starting to get them much quicker. You know, they’ve been really holding up – I mean, nine months, they have really been – that’s all they can do well. You know how many people I have in there? I have – I have a lot of people in there, and they complain to me. Like Woody Johnson. He’s the ambassador to the Court of St. James, which is England, you know, et cetera, et cetera. And I mean, he said what they did to him was unbelievable. The process was so ugly. I’ve had three or four people to be ambassadors, tremendous people, very successful people. They called me and they – their whole life they wanted to do this, and they gave up. It’s, you know –
INTERVIEWER: That’s the exciting stuff. (Laughter.) That’s the exciting stuff.
TRUMP: Right? Yeah, exactly. And then you leave. By the way, then the market crashes and it goes through the roof. You know, what you say. And then he goes off and he’ll play golf and relax for the next 30 or –
INTERVIEWER: So, Gary, Yellen, and there are other contenders you’re thinking of?
TRUMP: Yeah, there are people that are highly respected that I would certainly think about. I don’t know that Gary would want it. I think Gary loves what he’s doing, you know, and he’s doing a very good job.
INTERVIEWER: Who else –
INTERVIEWER: (Inaudible.)
INTERVIEWER: Sometimes needs to get a comment from Gary. (Laughter.)
TRUMP: You want to comment? (Laughs.)
INTERVIEWER: On the record. On the record.
INTERVIEWER: This is an interview with the president. This is an interview with the president.
INTERVIEWER: We’ll call your office.
INTERVIEWER: This is an interview with the president.
INTERVIEWER: Can I ask another economics question, while we’re on the subject?
TRUMP: Yeah.
INTERVIEWER: You tweeted this morning about trade talks with Britain.
TRUMP: Yes.
INTERVIEWER: Can you tell us more about what’s going on in the U.K?
TRUMP: No, but I can say that we’re going to be very involved with the U.K. I mean, you don’t hear the word Britain anymore. It’s very interesting. It’s like, nope.
INTERVIEWER: Did you see Jordan Spieth’s amazing finish at the Open?
TRUMP: I – well, I saw his first four holes. And I said, man, that’s the end of that, because – you know?
INTERVIEWER: Come on, you and I have hit worse drives.
TRUMP: No, no, but for – I know, but for a tour pro it was very unusual. But for a guy to then go birdie, eagle, birdie, birdie, that’s a special.
INTERVIEWER: He could – he could be a career major – he could be the youngest guy to do the career major –
TRUMP: Well, he’s actually sort of – he’s in with Tiger and Jack. He’s essentially even, you know, with a number of terms and a number of majors.
INTERVIEWER: Anyway, are you looking forward to doing a trade deal with the U.K.?
TRUMP: Yeah. I have a great relationship.
INTERVIEWER: It would be after, right? They have a time frame.
TRUMP: We have a very good relationship. I have a very good relationship with the prime minister. And we are absolutely looking to do a major trade deal.
INTERVIEWER: Would the idea be that the trade deal will kick in pretty much as soon as Brexit happens?
TRUMP: As soon as it’s appropriate to have it kick in, absolutely. And it’ll be a big trade deal – much, much more business than we do right now, many, many times.
INTERVIEWER: Are there keys that would be the important pieces of it? What would – can you highlight specific –
TRUMP: There’ll be certain pieces. It’s not – there’ll be certain pieces. I mean, one of the things that – I have a very good relationship with the EU people and all, but they are very, very protectionist. You know, our farmers and others can’t even deal with – you know, you can’t sell in. It’s very unfair. And that’s what I’ve been talking about for a long time. It’s so stacked against the United States. Now, the EU was conceived to the point that they wanted to do something to compete with the United States. Well, you know, you could say that’s a friendly act or an unfriendly act. But it’s very protectionist. Among the most, we have farm products that you just can’t get into the EU. And we don’t do that to them.
INTERVIEWER: So you’d include an agriculture deal with the U.K.?
TRUMP: Well, I’ll tell you, you know, I did – I did thing that nobody even wrote about – although, you did. (Laughter.) But when I was with President Xi, who I have a very good relationship with, I said: Do me a favor. Would you allow cattle, please, to come in? I was last night in West Virginia, and I had farmers coming up to me and hugging me and kissing me because of the cattle stuff. They actually weren’t from West Virginia; they were from other places. (Laughter.) But, you know, it was the Boy Scouts, so they came from all over the country, but –
INTERVIEWER: Could you do a services deal with the U.K.? Could that include services?
TRUMP: Yeah. It would include everything.
INTERVIEWER: Including financial services?
TRUMP: Oh, no, it would be very – it would be – it would be very all-in.
INTERVIEWER: That’s a big deal.
INTERVIEWER: Because we have a lot of financial companies already paring back their numbers, moving people to Frankfurt, already clearing out of London some. Do you think that’s a good idea right now, ahead of this?
TRUMP: That’s up to them. But we’re going to have a very good relationship with the U.K. And we do have to talk to the European Union, because it’s not a reciprocal deal, you know. The word reciprocal, to me, is very important. For instance, we have countries that charge us 100 percent tax to sell a Harley-Davidson into that country. And yet, they sell their motorcycles into us, or their bikes, or anything comparable, and we charge them nothing. There has to be a reciprocal deal. I’m all about that. And you know, it’s very interesting, at the border – people may have problems with border, but when you say reciprocal, everybody says, oh, that’s fair. So people have a problem with charging a 10 percent tax, which they shouldn’t have but they do. But when you say you’re going to charge reciprocal charge – in other words, what they charge we’re going to charge – all of a sudden these same people – it might be much more money – but these same people, all of a sudden they’re OK with it. So we have got to be much smarter.
INTERVIEWER: What about – just, very quickly, on tariffs. On steel tariffs, you committed to imposing steel tariffs. You haven’t done that, but you still –
TRUMP: Well, we’re waiting – we’re waiting till we get everything completed. We don’t want to do at this moment. We’re going to – we’re going to wait till we get everything completed here. We’re going to see. It’s a very unfair situation. They’re dumping steel in our country. It’s extremely unfair. But we like to keep it as simple as – we like to keep very complicated subjects as simple as possible. So we’re waiting till we get everything finished up between health care and taxes and maybe even infrastructure. But we’re going to be addressing the steel dumping at a very – fairly soon.
INTERVIEWER: Do you think it’s salvageable? Do you think NAFTA’s salvageable?
TRUMP: It may be salvageable.
INTERVIEWER: What do you need for that?
TRUMP: I would say – I would say it may be salvageable. But certainly, I have an obligation to give it a shot.
INTERVIEWER: What are you looking for specifically –
TRUMP: I’m looking for fairness.
INTERVIEWER: But what does that – can you give an example?
TRUMP: No, it means – look, our automobile industry has just left us and gone to Mexico – I mean, a big chunk of it. And it’s very unfair for them to take our companies, built their cars, and then sell the car back into our country with no tax. It’s very unfair. They fire all our people in Michigan and Ohio, and they take it, and they build a car. And now they sell the car back in with no tax. It’s not fair.
INTERVIEWER: What does the president of Mexico say when you say that?
TRUMP: He’s not thrilled. But that’s OK. I wasn’t thrilled about what he said to me.
INTERVIEWER: Does he – but does he disagree with you about that view, or does he –
TRUMP: Oh, there’s not much to disagree with. Look, we have a $70 billion – we have a $70 billion trade deficit. What is anybody saying? With China, we have 350 to 504. Nobody can really define it, deficit. We have a trade deficit of $350 to $504 billion each year. We’re not going to be – it’s just not going to happen that way anymore.
INTERVIEWER: You mentioned the Iran deal, but it’s been certified as in compliance twice now. It comes up again in September. Would you – is there going to come a point where you just –
TRUMP: Well, we’re doing major studies. Oh, I would be very surprised if they will be – look, we’ve been extremely nice to them. We’ve been extremely nice to them in saying they were compliant, OK? We’ve given them the benefit of every doubt. But we’re doing very detailed studies. And personally, I have great respect for my people. If it was up to me, I would have had them noncompliant 180 days ago.
INTERVIEWER: Do you expect them to be declared noncompliant the next time?
TRUMP: Personally, I do. I do.
INTERVIEWER: In September?
TRUMP: I think they’ll be noncompliant. I think they’re taking advantage of this country. They’ve taken advantage of a president, named Barack Obama, who didn’t know what the hell he was doing. And I do not expect that they will be compliant.
INTERVIEWER: Will you overrule your staff on that, if they come back with a recommendation –
TRUMP: Oh, sure. Sure. Look, I have a lot of respect for Rex and his people, good relationship. It’s easier to say they comply. It’s a lot easier. But it’s the wrong thing. They don’t comply. And so we’ll see what happens. I mean, we’ll talk about this subject in 90 days. But, yeah, I would be – I would be surprised if they were in compliance.
STAFF: INTERVIEWERPresident? I’m sorry. We just have time for a few more.
INTERVIEWER: INTERVIEWERPresident –
INTERVIEWER: OK, if I may, can I ask you quick, INTERVIEWERPresident, we’ve talked about your achievements and disappointments. I was reminded of President Eisenhower, when he left office, said that his two biggest mistakes in officer were both sitting on the Supreme Court. From things you’ve been saying in the –
TRUMP: So far I can’t say that, right?
INTERVIEWER: From the same – from the things you’ve been saying in the last week or so, and tweeting, it sounds as though you may think that maybe your biggest mistake is running the Justice Department. Is that –
TRUMP: I’m disappointed in Jeff Sessions, yes.
INTERVIEWER: Do you want him to leave?
TRUMP: Number one, they should go after the leakers in intelligence. I don’t mean the White House stuff where they’re fighting over who loves me the most, OK? (Laughter.) It’s just stupid people doing that.
INTERVIEWER: Anthony’s already taken care of that. (Laughter.)
TRUMP: I know, that’s just – and Anthony will handle that. [aughter.] I can – Anthony can do that out of his back pocket, OK? I’m talking about intelligence leaks. I’m talking like the story about Syria that was in The New York Times the other day. I’m – which by the way, was a decision made by people, not me. But, you know, they wrote it 100 – it was in the –
INTERVIEWER: The Post, I thought. It was in The Washington Post.
TRUMP: It was in The Washington Post. That was not something that I was involved in, other than they did come and they suggested. It turns out it’s – a lot of al-Qaida we’re giving these weapons to. You know, they didn’t write the truthful story, which they never do. So all of those things are very important. But, no, I’m very disappointed in the fact that the Justice Department has not gone after the leakers. And they’re the ones that have the great power to go after the leakers, you understand. So – and I’m very disappointed in Jeff Sessions.
INTERVIEWER: You can fire him.
TRUMP: Look, Jeff – I could. But we’ll see what happens. But I was – I appointed a man to a position. And then shortly after he gets the position, he recused himself. I said, what’s that all about? Why didn’t you tell me that you were going to do that, and I wouldn’t have appointed you? But I appointed him. And shortly thereafter, he recused himself. So I think that is 
INTERVIEWER: You also suggested in Cleveland today they should be going – or, yesterday – they should be going after Hillary Clinton. Is that –
TRUMP: Well, I didn’t – I wouldn’t have wanted to. But I see the way they go after us on a witch hunt, you know? The Russian – the Russian story’s all an excuse for the Democrats losing. In fact, if you read the book, “Shattered,” they have a whole chapter where they sat the day after the election and they said: Yeah, Russia. It was Russia. And, you know, Trump was involved. OK, the one thing interesting, you never heard me even associated with anybody. But, no, that’s a total witch hunt, the whole Russia story. It’s a hoax. It’s a hoax. We had no collusion with Russia. We never dealt with Russia.
People that were on the campaign, like Corey, came in yesterday. It was very interesting. He was being interviewed. He said – I was watching, Corey Lewandowski – he says: I was here from the beginning. And I must be honest with you, I never dealt with any Russians. He was only the campaign manager. I can even look at Hope. She was here from virtually the same day that Corey started, those two. Hope, how many Russians have you seen involved in the campaign, OK?
INTERVIEWER: You going to veto the Russian sanctions legislation?
TRUMP: Well, I haven’t seen them yet. I haven’t seen them in final form. I will say this, Congress, if they’re going to negotiate, they make the worst deals I’ve ever seen. They made NAFTA. They made – you know, they allowed the Iran deal to go through.
INTERVIEWER: You said you’re opposed –
TRUMP: I make good deals. I don’t make bad deals. I make good deals. So, but, I haven’t made my – I have not seen them. I have to see. By the way, a lot of things have taken place in that agreement that are a lot different from what it was two weeks ago – a lot of things.
