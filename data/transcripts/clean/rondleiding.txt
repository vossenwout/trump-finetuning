INTERVIEWER: This office.
TRUMP: Right.
INTERVIEWER: Is all you. And it's a little bit junky.
TRUMP: Yeah. You know what? This I just got a few weeks ago. This is from the Marine Corps. That's the chair for the apprentice that I use.
INTERVIEWER: Oh, wow.
TRUMP: These are different things. Tom Brady Super bowl helmet.
INTERVIEWER: Wow.
TRUMP: This is Mike Tyson's belt. This is Vince McMahon from the World Wrestling Federation. This is Shaquille O'Neal shoe.
INTERVIEWER: Oh, my God.
TRUMP: Right here, which is a serious shoe.
INTERVIEWER: Is that a real shoe?
TRUMP: That's a real shoe. He took it off after a game and handed it to him.
INTERVIEWER: Oh, my God.
TRUMP: I carried it like this.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah. I guess because you don't really like germs anyway, do you?
TRUMP: No. From Shaq.
INTERVIEWER: How are you handling the campaign? Shaking hands when you don't like germs?
TRUMP: Well, I mean, it's been proven, you know, you say, can somebody has a cold? You probably catch a cold. But I do it because you have to do it. And it's one of those things. This is some serious foot.
INTERVIEWER: Yep.
TRUMP: So all different things. And, of course, the big thing is the view of New York City.
INTERVIEWER: Now, do you live upstairs?
TRUMP: I live upstairs, yes.
INTERVIEWER: In the penthouse?
TRUMP: Yes.
INTERVIEWER: Okay. So do you think the White House is going to be as nice as your penthouse?
TRUMP: The White House is very special. So is Trump Tower. But the White House is a very special place. It represents something that can be so good. And you will see what I'm talking about.
INTERVIEWER: Do you, how does your baby son feel about it? Because he would be the one who would live there.
TRUMP: Well, I think he feels great. I mean, he didn't know if it was such a shot, but now he's saying, dad, you're winning. You're winning. I don't know. I'm not sure I like it. You know, it's very interesting.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah. Yeah.
TRUMP: But he. He would be very happy, I think.
INTERVIEWER: How old is he right now?
TRUMP: He's now nine. Just turned nine.
INTERVIEWER: Uh huh. Okay. All right. Now, are you gonna get down to business when we leave you, or are you gonna get down to politics?
TRUMP: I get down to business and politics. You know, I'm running a business, and at the same time, I'm running for office, whereas a politician, they only have to do the one thing. But I'm running a big business and also running for office. So as the days go by, I give more and more to my children to run and my executives. I have great executives, and that's not going to be a problem.
INTERVIEWER: So what's a normal day right now for you?
TRUMP: Well, I would how much is, I get up at 5530, read the papers, including the Wall Street Journal, but I read the Wall Street Journal, the Times, I read the different papers, and then I try and watch as much as I can. Television, you're seeing more and more with the politics because there's so much on television. Then I get to the office at 08:00 830.
INTERVIEWER: Now, do you exercise or you just stay in shape on your own?
TRUMP: Well, I exercise a little bit. Not as much as I would like to. I don't have time, really. And I do a lot of exercising because I walk around a lot. I'm doing a lot of things. Even when you're at a podium making a speech and you're ranting and that's exercise, talking to yourself. You're standing up for an hour and 20 minutes and you're speaking to a great audience. So I get plenty of exercise. I like to play golf whenever I can, but it's not as much as I'd like to be able to play.
INTERVIEWER: You're supposed to be a pretty good golfer.
TRUMP: I'm a pretty good golfer. You know, you get to know people on a golf course and you learn about people. I've won many club championships. And when you can win club championships, that tells you something. You know, winning a club championship is hard because you're competing against other very good players and it's hard. So you win many of them and you feel good about yourself. It's not.
INTERVIEWER: So what's your handicap?
TRUMP: I guess I'm a four now. I would have been better, but I haven't been played, but I would say a four.
INTERVIEWER: And that's really good.
TRUMP: It's pretty good. Yeah, I'm a pretty good player.
INTERVIEWER: Okay, so then you come in here at eight, and then do you mostly do political meetings? Business meetings. What are you most focused on?
TRUMP: Well, I would say now it's starting to be, maybe the political's taking over a little bit over the business and the business I'm giving more and more of over the executives and my children to run. But, you know, right now it's pretty much even.
INTERVIEWER: A lot of people call you the Donald. Has it all blended or do you sometimes feel like you're just Donald, or do you feel like you have to be the Donald and be on stage?
TRUMP: Honestly, I don't think about it. I just do what I have to do. If you start thinking about that, bad things happen. You just have to do what you have to do. I come in, I do work like everybody else. I live maybe a different life, or maybe not a different life, but I work hard. We can work hard. We have to work hard. If I win, I'm going to have to work so hard. But we're going to make, and I've said it, we're going to make the country better than it ever was. And we have a chance of doing that better. I don't mean just bring it back. We have a chance at making it better than it ever was. There's such incredible potential, such incredible people. And you mark my words, we'll be doing this in three or four years, hopefully together. And I think you're going to be, I hope you're going to be very impressed.
INTERVIEWER: Okay. We'll come back and see.
TRUMP: Thank you.
INTERVIEWER: Okay. Thanks.
TRUMP: Thank you very much. Marty.
