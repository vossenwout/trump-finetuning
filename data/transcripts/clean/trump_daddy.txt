TRUMP: Back. White? Yeah. White jacket? Yeah. Go ahead, give my mic. Hello.
INTERVIEWER: Deborah Haynes from Sky News. Mark Rutter, the NATO chief. Who is your friend? He called you Daddy earlier. Do you regard your NATO allies as kind of children?
TRUMP: No, he likes me. I think he likes me. If he doesn't, I'll let you know. I'll come back and I'll hit him hard. Okay? He did. He did it very affectionately. Daddy, you're my dad.
INTERVIEWER: Do you regard your NATO allies, though, as kind of like children? And they're obviously listening to you and they're spending more and you're obviously appreciative of that, but do you hope that actually they're going to be able to defend themselves, defend Europe on their own without.
TRUMP: I think they need help a little bit at the beginning, and I think they'll be able to. And I think they're going to remember this day. And this was a big day for NATO. You know, this was a very big day. They took it. One of the gentlemen said, you know what? We've been trying to raise money for, raised the rate for 30 years. He said, 20 years, from almost the beginning. And he's been there for a long time. He said, until you came along, it never happened. What you did is amazing. It's been sort of an amazing day for a lot of reasons, but also for that. Yeah, go ahead.
INTERVIEWER: Do you think they can do it without you, though, in the future? Can they do it with.
TRUMP: Well, ask Mark. I mean, you have to ask Mark. Okay, so we're heading back. We're heading back. I want to thank these two gentlemen behind me. They're incredible people, both of them. They're really. They've done a fantastic job. And Susie's in the front and she's done great. And Monica, thank you very much. That was quite an exciting time. And we're going to be heading back. We'll be back soon and we'll. We'll see you in Washington, D.C. remember this. We have the hottest country anywhere in the world. Thank you very much, everybody. Thank you.
