INTERVIEWER: We got a readout of your call with Vladimir Putin and it was a fairly optimistic take. Vladimir Putin agreed to a ceasefire immediately on energy and infrastructure, but not to a 30 day cease fire. Tell us what happened.
TRUMP: Well, you have a situation where you have a lot of guns pointing at each other foolishly, because it would have never happened if I were president. That was not a war, that was supposed to happen and it did happen. So that's where we are. And right now you have a lot of guns pointing at each other. And a ceasefire without going a little bit further would have been tough. Russia has the advantage, as you know, they have encircled about 2,500 soldiers. They are nicely encircled and that's not good. And we want to get it over with. Look, we're doing this. There are no Americans involved. There could be if you end up in World War III over this, which is so ridiculous. But you know, strange things happen. And I think we had a great call, it lasted almost two hours. Talked about a lot of things and toward getting it to peace and we talked about other things also.
INTERVIEWER: Was there non negotiables mentioned by Putin? It was reported, I think the Kremlin media actually stated that he demanded an immediate cessation of aid to Ukraine in order to get to this multi step deal.
TRUMP: No, he didn't. We didn't talk about aid actually. We didn't talk about aid at all. We talked about a lot of things, but aid was never discussed.
INTERVIEWER: In the readout it also stated that both sides want to get to an improved bilateral relationship, the United States and Russia.
TRUMP: That's true.
INTERVIEWER: How can we trust that Vladimir Putin actually wants that and that he's not also being influenced at the same time by his close friend President Xi of China?
TRUMP: Well, look, we have our own discussions with President Xi of China and he wants to get along also. And he's looking to get along and we're looking to get along with him and we will. We have a problem of trade where we have a very big imbalance with China, with Russia. We don't have that much trade. And they'd like to. And we'd like to also. They have some very valuable things for us, including very big forms of rare earth. They have a lot of Earth. You know, they have a big chunk of real estate, the biggest, actually, the biggest in the world for a country by far. And on that they have things that we could use, frankly, and that other people could use. I think that President Xi would like to get along, and I think Russia wants to get along with the United States. I also think we're a much different country than we were just a few months ago. We're a country that's now respected. We were not respected. We were being laughed at. We had incompetent leadership. This was a war as an example that would have never happened if I were president.
INTERVIEWER: Is part of your desire to forge this new relationship with Russia also impacted by Russia's closer relationship since you left office in 2021, with China? Because I think you talked about before the desire to box out China from that part of the world and have a closer relationship with Russia.
TRUMP: So as a student of history, which I am, and I've watched it all, the first thing you learn is you don't want Russia and China to get together. With that being said, no, it's not a big part of it, but maybe that'll happen or maybe it won't. Obama really forced them together through energy and bad energy policies. And what he did so many different things. He forced a marriage which would never have taken place. It was not a natural and for one reason. Russia has tremendous land, a lot of land, and China doesn't have enough land. Russia has a much smaller population than China, and it's sort of a natural. It was always a natural enemy situation. They're probably friendly now, but we're going to be friendly with both. I think we're going to be friendly with both. China needs us in terms of trade very badly, but we have to straighten out the deficit. We have now more than a trillion dollar deficit. With China, it's not even believable. And we're going to be doing something about that. And with Russia, they would like to have some of our economic power.
INTERVIEWER: The criticism that you've heard since really 2015 is that you have more in common with Vladimir Putin than you do with globalist leaders, maybe some NATO leaders, and in this case with Zelenskyy. You're both nationalists. Zelenskyy's more of a globalist. How do you respond to that criticism?
TRUMP: Well, I am a nationalist, but I'm a nationalist for the United States, not for anybody else. And it's interesting because there's nobody been tougher on Russia than me. I'm the one that pointed out Nord Stream 2. And I stopped it. Nord Stream's the biggest pipeline, I guess, in the world, taking care of all of Europe. And it was being built from before I got there, and they somehow they were on the way it was going to be, and I stopped it. It was just stone cold dead. I stopped it in its tracks. That's not somebody that's being particularly. That was the biggest project they ever had. I had it stopped. When Biden got in, he immediately approved it, like, immediately. One of the first things he did in office was he Approved Nord Stream 2. Nobody ever heard of Nord Stream until I was president. I said, what are you doing? You mean you're building a pipeline to Germany and various places in Europe, you're paying them billions of dollars a month, and then we're paying a lot of money to fight them? This is not going to work out well. And it stopped. And then Biden approved it, which was a really stupid thing to do, but he did it. And Putin actually said to me, if you're my friend, I'd hate to see you as my enemy. He said that very strongly put. But I had, with all of that, I had a very good relationship with Putin. I had a very good relationship with President Xi, a very good relationship with Kim Jong Un of North Korea. Lots of good relationships. And that's a positive thing, that's not a negative thing. But at the same time, I'm about our country. So that's why we're talking about tariffs. We'll be taking in trillions of dollars.
INTERVIEWER: I'm going to get to the tariffs in a minute because we're going to first hit the other big news of the day, which was the Chief justice of the Supreme Court issued what a rare statement about your suggestion on truth that you posted earlier today that Judge James Boasberg should be impeached after he ordered those deportation flights to El Salvador halted. Essentially turned around, the chief justice said, more than two centuries. We understood that essentially impeachment was for very rare circumstances and not an appropriate response to rulings you disagree with. What's your reaction to the courts stepping in to make a statement here? They didn't make a statement when Joe Biden decided to forgive all those student loans.
TRUMP: Well, he didn't mention my name in the statement. I just saw it quickly. He didn't mention my name. But many people have called for his impeachment, the impeachment of this judge. I don't know who the judge is, but he's radical left. He was Obama appointed, and he actually Said we shouldn't be able to take criminals, killers, murderers, horrible, the worst people, gang members, gang leaders, that we shouldn't be allowed to take them out of our country. Well, that's a presidential job. That's not for a local judge to be making that determination. And I thought it was terrible. In fact, he said, when they were well on their way, there was an order issued, as I understand it, to bring them back or to not let him go or something. And this is not something that the country would stand for. These people, they were let in here by an incompetent president who had open borders and anybody throughout the world could come in. And we were given murderers. We were given people from mental institutions and prisons.
INTERVIEWER: The judge is essentially saying, excuse me, Mr. President, that there still is a process in place. You can read between the lines. It hasn't been a full ruling yet. I know your Justice Department is appealing this on a couple of different grounds, but this is leading people to wonder whether there are court orders that you will defy because you believe that the judge has no jurisdiction or. Or they're political questions and not justiciable at all. And what would you say to that? Are there circumstances where you would defy a court order?
TRUMP: Well, I think that, number one, nobody's been through more courts than I have. I think nobody knows the courts any better than I have. I would say the chief judge does, but nobody knows them better than I have and what they've done to me. I've had the worst judges. I've had crooked judges. I have judges that valued Mar a Lago at $18 million because that benefited his case, because he wanted be convicted of something. I have judges that were. Had relatives making millions and millions of dollars on the election, ruling on the election.
INTERVIEWER: But going forward, would you defy a court order? We all know that was outright no.
TRUMP: I never. I never did defy a court order.
INTERVIEWER: And you wouldn't in the future?
TRUMP: No, you can't do that. However, we have bad judges. We have very bad judges. And these are judges that shouldn't be allowed. I think they. I think at a certain point, you have to start looking at what do you do when you have a rogue judge. The judge that we're talking about, he' syou look at his other rulings. I mean, rulings unrelated, but having to do with me. He's a lunatic.
INTERVIEWER: He wants details of when flights departed and trying to. I guess they seem to be trying to lay the predicate for your administration having defied a court order. Now, you all have said you haven't given specific times and you filed a motion in court, your Justice Department, to prevent any more information getting out about specific times of flights. So that seems to be where this is going. Do you have faith that the Supreme Court ultimately will rule your in your favor in this case?
TRUMP: I do. Because the job of getting people out of our country that are murderers, that are absolutely the worst people. The drug lords are causing such problems in this country. You know, drug lords came in, the biggest of them. They left other countries to come in here. They came through an open border. They're making millions of dollars destroying people's lives, killing people. And that's a presidential thing. We're supposed to be getting them out or getting them brought to justice. We had a judge. I would call him a rogue judge. You can call him whatever you want. I know nothing about him. I heard about this very late in the process, and I said, that's a strange order. You have local judges, local federal judges, local judges, period, and DAs and prosecutors, DAs, state attorney generals, attorney generals that want to really take over. I think some of it's for the publicity. They love the publicity. All of a sudden they're on the front page of every newspaper, but they have no right to be.
INTERVIEWER: When we come back, President Trump reacts to the latest Doge news and it's a court ruling. More my interview with the president next. Now more of my interview with President Trump. Moving on to Doge. Judge Theodore Chuang is a federal district court judge in Maryland. Has ruled against the Trump administration's efforts, Mr. President, to shut down USAID, ordering the government on an accelerated basis to basically reinstate the agency's statutory functions. Your reaction to this development?
TRUMP: Look at the fraud that we've caught. We've caught so much fraud, so much waste, so many employees that never showed up to work. And we have a judge from a very liberal state who ruled like that, so bad for our country.
INTERVIEWER: So I guess they closed the department. They're going to have to reopen our department.
TRUMP: Well, we'll be appealing it. I guess not, I guess. I guarantee you we will be appealing it. We have rogue judges that are destroying our country.
INTERVIEWER: Well, do you believe that at this point, given the totality of these lawsuits, it's a cavalcade of lawsuits that your administration could be further hampered, your agenda could be slowed down. They're throwing monkey wrenches at you with these judicial rulings.
TRUMP: Well, we have to go through an appellate process that takes a long time. We have a judge that.
INTERVIEWER: Do you have time?
TRUMP: We Have a judge.
INTERVIEWER: That's the point.
TRUMP: We have time. We're going to be making a lot of money because of tariffs. The good news is we've got it on. We're going to very soon be on an even keel. We're going to be taking in a lot of money. The trump card, the gold card, whatever they want to call it's okay with me. Whatever's going to sell better is fine with me. It'd be nice to get a piece, but I don't get a piece, okay? I get nothing out of it. All I do is want to make this country successful again. We're taking in tremendous amounts of money. We have car companies that are building here who six months ago were going to build in Mexico, massive plants. They're building them in the United States. We have. Honda is going to Indiana. We have them opening up in Michigan. It's amazing what's happening.
INTERVIEWER: But judges. But for federal judges, district court judges to order a sitting president to reinstate fired employees. You're the chief executive officer of the United States. You order that these agencies fired employees.
TRUMP: Many of whom didn't even report to work, many of whom were scamming this country. And you. You see the same thing. I could read them off, and I did during various speeches. I read off deal after deal after deal, all big scams. And we have a guy that wants to make a name for himself. You know, in many cases, they're just grandstanders. They want to make a name for themselves. So we'll appeal it, and hopefully we will meet with reasonable appeals. You know, I've won great cases on appeals.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, some of them, maybe people weren't fired. Maybe they were temporarily put on suspended. So we'll see how this plays out. But he's very unhappy with what happened at usaid.
TRUMP: Well, he shouldn't be. You know what he should do? He should really look at where the money went. They don't ever want to do that. You know, the Democrats always talk about, oh, our Constitution's been violated. The one thing they never talk about is, where did these billions of dollars go? They never want to look, because when you see where the money went and the scams, you don't even have to see anything. Just look at the heading and the scam that they've created. And a judge like him will never look at that. They'll just say, oh, you want to. It sounds so nice. Usaid, isn't that beautiful? But it's a whole big scam, Laura. And a judge like that is so bad. For our country.
INTERVIEWER: Well, it'd be interesting to see whether you're able to shrink the size of this government. Every Republican president has claimed a desire to. Even Obama said we have to find ways, fraud and abuse. But you're actually doing it and the judges are trying to stop you.
TRUMP: We're doing it, by the way. We're doing it at levels never seen before.
INTERVIEWER: Lunatics are setting fire Teslas all across the country. Another horrible incident happened in Las Vegas last night. The FBI is on the scene investigating and there is an ongoing investigation being led by Pam Bondi. In what you've seen so far, do you consider what's happening an act of domestic political terrorism against one of your allies?
TRUMP: So Elon is a patriot. And again, I hardly knew Elon until the. And he turned out that he liked me better than he liked these radical lunatics that were better than Kamala, better than Joe, you know, cuz he's an intelligent person. He liked and he backed me and he went and he got very much involved. He thought he actually would go around saying, if Trump doesn't win, our country is over.
INTERVIEWER: But do you consider this an act of domestic terrorism?
TRUMP: I think I think so.
INTERVIEWER: Why?
TRUMP: I think that if and when they catch the people, and I hope they do, the good thing is they have a lot of cameras in those places and, and they've caught some already having to do with that. I think that you will find out that they're paid by people that are very highly political on the left.
INTERVIEWER: Meanwhile, it's because of Elon Musk, everything he did with SpaceX, that those astronauts stranded for nine months, they're finally coming home. Mr. President, your reaction to what's unfolding?
TRUMP: So when I came in office, I said, elon, we got to get them out. You have a rocket ship handy. How many people have a rocket? And Biden left them up, he abandoned them. You know, we could have done this sooner, but Biden didn't want to because he was embarrassed by what happened. So they were up there. They were supposed to be there for a few days. They were there for many months and now they're coming back. But think of it. Elon's able to do that with his genius and you have people that hate it. And I really believe these are people that hate our country. It's a big problem. But, you know, they don't. There aren't so many of them. There are many more that love our country and they love our country now more than they have maybe ever in their lives. There's never Been a movement like maga, like America First. Call it whatever you want to call it. This is the greatest movement in the history of politics.
INTERVIEWER: What's the next stop for the astronauts? Are they going to be coming to the White House?
TRUMP: No, they're going to. Number one, they have to get better. You know, when you're up there and you have no pulling your muscle, you have no gravity, you can lift £1,000 like this. They have to get. They have to get better. It's going to be a little bit tough for them. It's not easy. You know, they're up a long time. And when they do, they'll come to the Oval Office.
INTERVIEWER: Now more of my interview with President Trump. They have a $60 billion trade deficit. China has like a 300 billion. Last year you said it goes up. When you add it all up, it's a trillion.
TRUMP: Way over 100. Canada. And here's my problem with Canada was meant to be the 51st state because we subsidize Canada by $200 billion a year. We don't need their cars. We don't need their lumber. We have a lot of lumber. We got. We freed it up, as, you know, last week. We're freeing it up so that you can actually cut down a tree without being, you know, given the death penalty. Because what these, what these radical environmentalists have done to our country. But we freed it up. But we don't need their lumber. We don't need their energy. We don't need anything. We certainly don't want their automobiles. They make. A lot of millions of automobiles are sent in. I'd rather have a made in Michigan. I'd rather have them made in South Carolina or any one of our tougher.
INTERVIEWER: With Canada than you are with some of. Only because our biggest adversaries.
TRUMP: Only because it's meant to be our 51st street. But listen to this for a second.
INTERVIEWER: We need their territory. They have territorial advantage. We're not one of the most close to China.
TRUMP: Look, I deal with every country indirectly or directly. One of the nastiest countries to deal with is Canada. The people that. Now, this was Trudeau. The people that. Good old Justin, I call him Governor Trudeau. He was. His people were nasty and they weren't telling the truth. They never told the truth. You know that. You know, they'd say, well, we don't charge. Well, they do. They charge tremendous. They charge tremendous. And if you look at dairy products, what they've done to our farmers, I'd go up to Iowa, I'd go Up to different places, Nebraska. And they would always complain about Canada, how they get ripped off. Do you know that Canada has a 250% tariff? 250. Nobody knows that. They charge us numbers that are crazy. But what is that? We have a very big deficit with Canada and 60 billion. There's no reason. Much more. We have much more.
INTERVIEWER: I just think so.
TRUMP: Just so you understand, we subsidize Canada. And I like Canada. I love Canada. I love Canada. But now the Liberal guy, I love his wife.
INTERVIEWER: The Liberal Party is going to win that in the next election, most likely. And they were, they were down and I out. Isn't that going to make them more hostile to us? And possibly I'd rather deal with a liberal than a conservative for China, closer to Canada. And that would really put us in a bind.
TRUMP: The conservative that's running is stupidly no friend of mine. I don't know him, but he said negative things. So when he says negative things, I couldn't care less. I think it's easier to deal actually with a liberal and maybe they're going to win, but I don't really care. It doesn't matter to me at all.
INTERVIEWER: So your end game is what with them?
TRUMP: My end game is I don't want to have a big deficit. I don't want to see the United States of America. And you say 60 and I say 200, but it doesn't matter. I don't want us to pay 60 or $200 billion to a country that if they were a state, think of this. It would be our biggest, most beautiful. It would be great. This state. It would be cherished. We'd take care of it. The people would pay half what they're paying right now. You know, Canada pays very little for defense. They think we're going to defend them.
INTERVIEWER: We protect them.
TRUMP: What?
INTERVIEWER: We protect them.
TRUMP: We protect them. We protect them. Do you know in NATO they pay less than anybody else in everything else they go, we bought. We're in the process of buying 48 icebreakers. All of a sudden I see Canada's involved. Where they're going to get a piece of them. I say, what are they paying? So I got tired of it. Here's the story. I had one of the most successful economies. I had the most successful economy in the history of our country. In my first four years. We did a great job. Largest tax cuts ever. Largest everything we had, right to try where people are able to use drugs stupidly for many years they weren't able to use, you know, the far reaching drugs because they weren't approved yet. Somebody's terminally ill. They couldn't do it with me. They can do it. We did so many things. We rebuilt our military. Canada doesn't pay for military. They don't give any. They give us nothing. And they are the worst people to negotiate with of everybody.
INTERVIEWER: They got with usmca. You finally got them around the edge on that, though.
TRUMP: You got no, I got them there. And USMCA is good, but they cheat. You know, an agreement's good, but they cheat. And Mexico cheats also.
INTERVIEWER: China cheated on your 2019.
TRUMP: Can I tell you what?
INTERVIEWER: Phase one, they totally cheated and dropped it with Biden.
TRUMP: You had a great deal when Biden took over. He didn't push them. I would call up once every two weeks saying, you're not living up to the agreement. And they'd buy more corn, more this. So the most we ever did was $15 billion with China, the farmers and everything, and manufacturing. I had them up to 50 billion. And they were doing it when Biden get in. Do you think Biden called up President Xi and said, you're screwing us?
