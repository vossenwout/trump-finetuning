TRUMP: You know, you stand. We had the standard television stuff for many years, and that's still. I think, you know, I think it's underrated now. I think it's so very important. But. But there's a whole new thing. Elon interviewed me on something.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: And I think they said 275 million wow. Hits or. That's a lot of people. That was a.
INTERVIEWER: It's a nation.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: But it's a whole new. Different way of.
INTERVIEWER: Can I ask you. Getting the word out about Elon, specifically. Is he your favorite African American.
TRUMP: Piece of work? Okay. You know, he's a great guy.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: With. I mean, he's obviously a brilliant guy.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: I mean, when I saw the rocket engine engines come back, I said, what is that? Like a couple of years ago? You know, I've seen rockets go up and then they crash into the water. And I see the. The engines are coming back and they're landing.
INTERVIEWER: It's unbelievable.
TRUMP: They're landing and. And they land on a raft in the middle of the ocean someplace with a little dot, and they land right on the top of the spot.
INTERVIEWER: And my wife can't parallel park.
TRUMP: I know most people can't. But. But no, he's great. But he's got a great heart. He was with me, as you know, on the other night.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: And we were honoring a Man who got killed at a rally. Corey firefighter, great guy. And it was a beautiful evening, but Elon went out and he loved the crowd. He loves the country.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: And he's picked aside a lot of people, don't want to pick a set. I have a lot of people that are big supporters of me.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: But they. They won't go all out, you know, they can't. They're scared.
INTERVIEWER: There's a cost.
TRUMP: There's a cost. Yeah, there is a cost, but there's also a liability. I mean, you know, some people. I respect it a lot. When this guy was up there doing jumping jacks. You gotta vote for Trump. You gotta vote.
INTERVIEWER: He was jumping high.
TRUMP: Yeah, he was jumping high.
INTERVIEWER: Quite African.
TRUMP: He's in good shape. I looked. I'm looking at his waist. I'm saying, wait a minute, does he work out or something? But he's. He is. He really. And he had. He had a great time. And, you know, he's. He's not out that much. He's probably. Maybe a little. Would you say he's a little reclusive? Possibly? Yes, he is.
INTERVIEWER: He's also busy. He's going five different jobs.
TRUMP: He's very busy and be a little reclusive. But he. He had the greatest time. He was saying, look at these people. We had a hundred thousand. More than 100,000 people. It was a record. It was nobody's ever seen. And it was really. It was a celebration of a life. And it was really a maga. It was a maga deal. He was a big MAGA person. His family was there. And two other people that were very badly hurt were also celebrated. They were very badly hurt. They weren't actually expected to live.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: And they live. And they had incredible doctors. Some of those country doctors are better than the big doctors that we spend a lot of money on, and they don't do as good. I will tell you right now, we don't want to knock anybody, but those country doctors save two people. Because I was told that three. No, think of that. Three would be in trouble. And we were going to now, Corey, immediately. But the other two were so bad that they thought they would make it.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: And those country doctors, they pulled them. They pulled them together. They did a great job.
INTERVIEWER: Okay, so you're going back into this place where, you know, there was this assassination event. They hit you headshot, you survive.
TRUMP: Yeah. It was not a good feeling. Yeah.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
INTERVIEWER: Are you. Are you scared, by the way?
TRUMP: No, I'm not scared. You know, I sort of. I have an attitude suggesting it's sort of. It is what it is. Does that make any sense to you guys? You know, you do what you have to do. I felt it was important to go back. A lot of people, I guess, agreed with me because it was over 100. I think they said 108,000 people in the end. That's a lot of people.
INTERVIEWER: Several.
TRUMP: And. And I had no guitar. You know, if you have a guitar, it's easy. Yeah, I have guitar. I do have that. They like me very much. But. But I don't have a guitar.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, you have the guitar.
INTERVIEWER: Yes.
TRUMP: So anyway. But. But that was an amazing. It was amazing. I mean, no, I like it when somebody like Elon, who has a lot to lose, is willing to do what's right.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: Some people know it's right to do, and I'm not just talking about endorsements and all, but they don't want to do things because they're.
INTERVIEWER: They don't want it to cost.
TRUMP: They want to be politically correct. And actually they're doing a bad. You know, a bad thing, I think for themselves and for a lot of people, they may represent.
INTERVIEWER: Okay, opening line. When you walk out there, I mean, I was. I was wondering what you were going to say. And as a comedian, there's. You can seize the moment.
TRUMP: Yeah. And he was a hell of a comedian, by the way.
INTERVIEWER: I appreciate what the word is. So I hear you go.
TRUMP: I hear.
INTERVIEWER: You know, I see the video and you go up there and you go. As I was saying.
TRUMP: Right.
INTERVIEWER: Crowd goes berserk or what?
TRUMP: They went. I would say, crazy.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah. Yeah.
INTERVIEWER: And I was experienced.
TRUMP: I'll tell you how, you know, you have this as a comedian or even as a. Not as a comedian. Just when you make a speech, you make some very serious statement.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: So we're at a very serious and somber thing because we're celebrating a life that is no longer with us. And I wasn't sure whether or not that thing. I had it in my mind for a long time. Once I said, I'm going back, which I wanted to go back immediately. I wanted to actually finish my speech. Okay. When I got up, I said, let me finish my speech. But I'm surrounded by, like, eight very large men and a very wonderful woman. You saw that?
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
TRUMP: But I'm surrounded by guys. They said, sir, no way, go. And I. Blood pouring down. But I wanted to. I really wanted to finish my speech. I said, I think I had, like 50,000. I had a lot of people there.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: And you Know, when I went down, it was sort of like embarrassed. I said, I went down in front of all these people, you know, that was my first thing I said. I don't want to be embarrassed.
INTERVIEWER: You were embarrassed you went down after.
TRUMP: Well, you weren't exactly sure what the hell was happening at first, you know.
INTERVIEWER: But also you came back up with a fist, right?
TRUMP: That's one of the hardest pictures. But I was also.
INTERVIEWER: Did you hear them say he's down? Or were you just saying when I.
TRUMP: Got hit, I assume that it's funny. Is it? When I was down here, it is sort of strange. I guess now it's a little bit. We can smile a little bit. But not really because the three guys, one killed one, two very badly. But when I went down, I had total realization. It wasn't a surreal. You know, they talked about a surreal. That could be a surreal experience. Like when somebody, something happens, some traumatic thing happens. People are. They lose focus. They have no idea where they are. They. You know, I've heard many people where that happened. Something really terrible happens like that. It was just the opposite. I knew exactly what had happened. I got shot in the ear and Secret Service thought I may have been shot. Actually, they're pretty sure that I was shot all over because there was a lot of blood. Just a little fact. If you get shot in the ear, it's the bloodiest place. It bleeds more than anything else. Oh, wow. Now it's good to be shot this way. Not that way, that way. That's bad. So if I don't, if I, if I don't turn, I wouldn't be doing this right now. Gary.
INTERVIEWER: Guys, I got some stand up shows coming up for the Life Tour. These are the remaining shows of the Life Tour. This weekend will be in Minneapolis and Milwaukee. We are going to Denver the following week. We have added a third show there. Also going to Cincinnati that weekend we had a second show there. Rama, Ontario as well.

If you want to place your bets with steak, I'm gonna get picks from betting experts. You suck at gambling. Be honest with yourself for once in your life. You ain't want shit in your life. And I know this because I probably know sports more than most of y' all and I still be losing. So I just steal these guys picks because they're professional cappers. They call them. That means they're professional gamblers. This is a little euphemism. Anyway, I'm also going to talk some sports on there. We're going to live stream this Thursday, do a little live stream during the Thursday night football game. We're just going to have some fun, talk some sports. If you missed that, come see me. Fan bases. Let's get back to the show.
TRUMP: My son Don told me actually he's a great shooter. So is Eric. They're great shooters. They're like better than scratch. Okay. If you use. And they say it's amazing because it was 130 yards. To me that sounds like far away. But it's not for shooting. It's not. He said that would be like sinking a one foot putt for just a decent shooter. Wow. And I don't know if you guys are shooters, but they said if you're a shooter, it's almost impossible to miss. It's that close. It's really considered that close. I mean, 3, 4, 500 yards is very doable. But this is supposed to be very close. And so he said you. I think Don became more religious, actually. You want another truth? It had a big impact. He said it's impossible. The doctor actually, when I got to the hospital, they were fantastic. Butler Hospital. I get there and the doctor greeted me and looked at me and looked it over. He said, you are the luckiest man. I've ever met.
INTERVIEWER: Wow.
TRUMP: He said you should immediately go out and buy a lotto ticket. Can you imagine? He's telling me to buy a lotto ticket. There's blood all over the place. And he said I've never, he said I've been doing this for 25 years. I said. He said I've never seen a thing like this.
INTERVIEWER: Wow.
TRUMP: Because it's just, you know, just whacked. Whacked it. But it was something that was, you know, relatively, relatively not so bad compared to what could have happened. So I feel very lucky. It was an amazing experience. A horrible experience in most ways. In some ways it was beautiful because I was some. Somehow I, I Hopefully Corey's protected too. Who's the firefighter. And he's in a good place. Maybe a better place than we're in.
INTERVIEWER: Hopefully.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: Because this world is a little bit on the tough side. But it was, it was an amazing experience.
INTERVIEWER: Feel like increase in your spirituality after something.
TRUMP: Well maybe especially when I'm. I'm hearing from people that do shoot and, and are good at it that it was almost impossible to miss from you know like a one foot putt is. You start to very much. You gotta miss it. That's a bad putt, right?
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: He equated it to a one foot putt. When they say that I say wow, that's. So you're saying they said a bad shooter would hit you from that distance a hundred percent of the time. Wow. That's pretty, that's pretty bad.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: And here I am, we're doing this wonderful interview with four geniuses that are hot as pistols right here on this guy. Likewise. Pretty good stuff you got. So anyway, so but here we are.
INTERVIEWER: Who do you think tried to take you out?
TRUMP: So I'm going to give you some big breaking news. Right. I love that because you're. I know the kind of show and it's entertainment but it's also very serious. I mean I, I get the whole picture. And you know what? If it was just funny stuff you wouldn't have the success. You've got to be honest with you. Right.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: It's nice to intersperse it. But I'll give you something. So first of all I have great respect for the Secret Service and the guys that were with me. I went down and I did a good job going down because those bullets were winging over my head. If I would have been up for another couple of seconds I also wouldn't have been there.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: But I didn't consider that as lucky as Turning to the right at that one. It was like 1/16 of a second was the only time. Yeah, I was safe, essentially. If I would have gone a little further, I would have been hit. If I would have gone not as far, I would have been hit. I mean, I had like this little tiny moment. And the amazing thing is the sign is always on my left and it's always at the end. And I only use it 20% of the time, maybe even less than that. And this was a chart. This was a chart on immigration because I have the record. I did a great job in immigration. They are not doing too well right now.
INTERVIEWER: Stay on the breaking news.
TRUMP: Stay on the breaking news. So here's the breaking. So you have this shooter and you have another shooter. Right. So this shooter had three or so cell phones. The FBI has never gotten them opened.
INTERVIEWER: Wow.
TRUMP: The other shooter, three apps, they call them, and I believe they were foreign based apps from what I understand. Oh, wow. They haven't opened them and they're foreign based. And you know, you hear all about Iran because I was rough with Iran, but I want to see Iran do great. I want to see Iran do great.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: But I want to stop all the killing and all this and, and I was rough on Iran and they supposedly have a hit on me. In fact, I think it takes great courage for you people to be interviewing me because it could be now, you know.
INTERVIEWER: Well, we didn't know that before we got in here.
TRUMP: If you would have known that, you might not have done this. Exactly. In fact, this is. Is a good way of be getting the interview to be short. Exactly. All of a sudden he's going to say, you know, okay, that's it. Thank you very much, ladies and gentlemen.
INTERVIEWER: Go see my daughter.
TRUMP: They have three apps and foreign based. Two of them, maybe three of them are foreign based. They haven't opened them yet. Why wouldn't you open them? When you hear about Iran or when you hear about, you know, foreign. Then the other one had six cell phones and they haven't opened. Now, you know, it's very hard to open a cell phone. Only Apple can do it in theory, unless you have somebody. But they had no problem getting the J6 people's cell phones open. They opened their cell phones very quickly. You know, we have two countries. In a way, what's happening here is very bad. It's very dangerous. We almost had one because I had the greatest economy in the history of our country and people were coming together. We almost had one, but we really do have two right now. And it's a shame because I think we'll get them together. Success will bring us together. But they should get those phones opened. And, you know, when there's an assassination attempt on a former president who's now, I'm proud to say, leaning in all the polls against the Democrat, I don't know which one is running, you know, you don't know what the hell is going on. I'm the only one that had to run against two. I run against two Democrats. But this is a first. We do. We create a lot of firsts. Usually you run against somebody. Here I run. I had the debate. I was way up on him.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: And then they say, oh, let's. This is like with Dana White, a fighter. So you're fighting and the one guy's getting killed, and they say, oh, that's okay. Let's put in another fight to finish it off.
INTERVIEWER: Okay.
TRUMP: You're fighting to say, hey, wait a minute, I have a brand new fighter in here.
INTERVIEWER: WWE.
TRUMP: I spent $150 million on beating Biden. And then all of a sudden I hear that they're going to overthrow him. It was a. It was a coup. I mean, it really was. But I would like them to. To open up these apps and find out what's in there. And so he had six. Six cell phones. Who has six cell phones? Having six cell phones is weird. I have cell phones, if I ever have two. It's like a lot. Yeah, he had six cell phones. Why does he have them? And why haven't they opened up those cell phones?
INTERVIEWER: So if you had.
TRUMP: And it's different, you know, if you're a drug dealer, I think it's terrible in many ways. But I guess from another standpoint, Apple, the primary group, people buy those ones because they will never open them for any reason. But they got them open on J6. You know, they opened up their phones, but they don't open. And this is big stuff. This is an assassination attempt. And it could involve other countries.
INTERVIEWER: There was that San Bernardino shooter that they hacked. The FBI was able to hack into the phone. Apple didn't give it up, but they were.
TRUMP: There are some people in the world, very few that can, that have an ability to sometimes be able to hack in.
INTERVIEWER: Got it.
TRUMP: Very rarely, actually.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: It's an amazing thing when you think that with all the genius, you almost can't do it. But Apple has a key. And the key is, I mean, it just. They can do it immediately, but they don't do it. And they don't do it and that's one of the reasons that, like I hate to say it, drug lords feel very confident that they'll never be exposed. And they use their cell phones, their Apple phones, and maybe it's that way with other companies. I don't know. They have Samsung, they have other companies, but it's very hard. Apple is very strong on that. But when it comes to the assassination of a president, leading candidate.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: Former president, all that, I think the rules have to go out and they have to open those things and they have to find out. In terms of national security would say you have to either punish Apple or you have to get somebody that can do it. But in terms of national security. So the one guy has six phones, lots of messages to people. Who are those people he's calling when he's hiding behind a bush.
INTERVIEWER: So if you had to guess, I'm sure you thought, obviously you've thought about this a lot. It's an assassination attempt. If you had to guess, who do you think is responsible?
TRUMP: These are great questions. What the hell? I don't get these questions from the fake news. Yeah. Rosie o' Donnell's not asking us, like Deface the Nation. Have the woman of Brennan. She's on Deface the Nation. She was terrible with the way she handled J.D. vance, who did a great job the other night.
INTERVIEWER: He did.
TRUMP: But I don't get questions like that. Did you ever hear of the show Deface, ladies and gentlemen? It's Donald Trump on Deface to Nation. It's called Face to Nation. They hate. No, they spend. They spend millions of dollars. Name a show there. Oh, I see. You didn't hear. That's good. They spend millions of dollars on the name cbs. Yeah. And then I come along and I say to Face to. It's Face the Nation.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: Or Meet the Fake Press. You're good at this. I say Meet the fake press.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: And they spend all this money and then I say it once and it goes to millions of people. Yeah. But no, they are fake. But some of these questions. Some of these questions are much better. Well, thank you. I appreciate that. I'm honored. Much better. You still have an answer, though. That was the best of the question.
INTERVIEWER: Almost as your second best.
TRUMP: You almost charmed us out of it trying to get out of it. All right, fair enough. Well, look, if you look at assassinations or attempts, first of all, you realize I'm in a very dangerous business.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: Okay. Because 11 10. Think of this. 110 of 1% of auto races die.
INTERVIEWER: Yep.
TRUMP: Bull riders, I think that's pretty dangerous, right?
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: I don't know much about it, but I think it's. I wouldn't want to be on one of those suckers.
INTERVIEWER: No.
TRUMP: I see them flying off in the hoof is like an inch from the eye, and when it hits the eye, you're gone, right? Yeah, they are very. Well, it's about the same 1/10 of 1%.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: And other things. It's never much more than that. That's sort of maxed out, I think, you know.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: Race car drivers, bull runners, I think that's pretty much tough. UFC fighters, it's none. You know, I don't think anyone's ever.
INTERVIEWER: Actually not in ufc, in MMA or boxing, maybe it was those tragic events.
TRUMP: Amazingly, boxers die a lot, but UFC Danish tells me it's a safe sport. I say, to me it's much rougher, but, you know, it's pretty amazing. They've never. In ufc, they've never lost, and they run a great operation. They've never. Nobody's died. But with presidents, it's like a substantial.
INTERVIEWER: Way higher than we realize.
TRUMP: You look at Lincoln and Kennedy and this and that.
INTERVIEWER: Attempts.
TRUMP: Reagan, McKinley.
INTERVIEWER: Yep.
TRUMP: Garfield. You look at a lot of people. I'm in a very dangerous, Dangerous business. Profession. Yeah, I call it a profession. Yes, dangerous profession.
INTERVIEWER: I like that.
TRUMP: I'm sitting with you guys. You have a very nice, safe life. Me. So, no, if you said 5%, I.
INTERVIEWER: Think he called a soft.
TRUMP: No, but think of that. Yeah, but think of it. 5%. Yeah, that's a lot. That's a lot.
INTERVIEWER: And yeah, I think even the attempts is something like 25% is getting into really crazy number.
TRUMP: So people don't think of that. You know, you run and you see and then you win. And you're down Pennsylvania, you're looking everything. So you gotta. You're in a dangerous stuff.
INTERVIEWER: Yes. Yeah.
TRUMP: And so it's one of those things I was saying before, though, that, you know, I do a thing called the weave, and there are those that are fair, that say, this guy is so genius. And then others would say, oh, he rambled. I don't ramble. If I saw the story. What you do is you weave things and you do it. You have to have certain things. You need an extraordinary memory because you have to come back to where you started.
INTERVIEWER: Yes.
TRUMP: You always. A weave is only good. People give you credit for that. It's true.
INTERVIEWER: You could go all the way over here and then get.
TRUMP: Go so far here or there, and I can come back to exactly where I Started now, someday, when you don't come back to where you started, you're Biden. No, but the weave is the way when you're telling, like, a story. I was telling a story at a rally the other day in front of thousands of people, and I started off. And then you were weaving them something in the story. I actually mentioned Air Force One. It was Air Force One. Was they. So I mentioned Air Force One, and then I said how I got $1.6 billion off the price of Air Force One. So. But then you have to come back to the story. Where was Air Force One taken? So anyway, I do a weave. I call it the Weave. And some people think it's so genius, but the bad people, what they say is, you know, he was rambling. It's not a ramble. There's no rambling.
INTERVIEWER: This is a weave.
TRUMP: There's a weave. Good name. I'm not sure that's another name. We had fake news. We came up with lots of names. Ye. But the weave is. I think we should make the weave a part of that stable. Yeah.
INTERVIEWER: You really weed, right? Answering my question twice.
INTERVIEWER: So I don't even want to know the answer anymore.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: Let'S weave back to his question. This is where it started, so we'll weave back to it. So I. I sort of hate answering it because. Yeah.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: I don't want to give any false identities. I don't want to do anything having to do with creating something that isn't there. You would look at Iran. Iran has an open threat out for me. That's bad. And Biden, if he were a real president, if he were the kind of guy he should be, should say, if anybody shoots a former president who's now the leading candidate, even though he's leading against Democrats, we will bomb that country into oblivion. And it would stop. And that's been said before with some people. You know, there have been people. I won't go into it, but there have been people that have been threatened in another party, even in the same party. It makes sense and probably happens pretty quickly. But in another party, you know, it's hard for them to. To cross the line, to want to protect me.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: But it shouldn't be hard. Other people have protected other people. And what you have to inform those people is if they do it, the country will be blown to smithereens. The entire country will be blown to smithereens, and those threats go away, because that's a really bad threat for a country. Forget about me. I'm an individual. But I represent something very important. That's a really terrible threat. So, I mean, there are others that could be in that category. Look, I took in hundreds of billions of dollars from China at a level that no president. No president took in anything. I had tariffs on China took in hundreds of billions of dollars. They're still there that without me, they wouldn't have those tariffs. So you could say, but no, I think Iran would be the one.
INTERVIEWER: All right, guys, let's take a break for a second because we got to shout out the greatest law firm in America. Morgan and Morgan, America's largest personal injury law firm. For over 35 years, they've been fighting and winning for the just like you and me. They won so much that they've racked up more than $20 billion in recoveries for their clients. That's right.

TRUMP: I was tough with other countries, but I got along very well with them. But you know, we were like, we were like a pussycat. We were ripped off by every nation in the world. And some of the worst grippers were our so called allies. People that countries that we supposedly get along with us with, but they're the ones that took advantage of us on trade at a level like, you know, I mean, I ended some of the dumbest trade deals I've ever seen and made them much better for the country. I mean, what difference does it make? I made, I made, I took a terrible trade deal would make it a good trade deal but like Japan, I redid the trade deal. South Korea, I did the trade, the deals. I went to Abby of Japan, I said, shinzo, he was assassinated. He was, he was as you probably. He's incredible, great man. He's a great leader for the people. They loved him. I said, shinzo, look, we can't do this. The trade deal is so bad. We're friends, but I have to renegotiate the trade deal. And he said to me, I knew that would happen. I said, why did you know? Because you're right, it's so one sided. Wow. He said, I knew you'd catch us. But they went through many presidents where Japan was as an example. They'll send us millions of cars. We're not allowed to send them any. They send this us their, their farm product. We were sending them practically nothing. It was like a one way. Everything was one way. And by the way, virtually every China was the worst. But there were many countries almost as bad. The European Union was almost as bad in my opinion. You know, it sounds nice. Oh, the European Union is so nice. They were ruthless in their trading. And I said to Angela Merkel, how many Chevrolets do we have in the middle of Berlin? Why? I don't believe any. I said, you're right. And yet we take in the, you know, all of that. We take in Mercedes Benz, BMW and we take in all of this Volkswagen. We're taking in all of these millions and millions of cars. I say, how many American cars are in the middle of Munich or Berlin? And the answer is none. And I had things change around. So, you know, you could say, I think that the answer would be at this moment Iran. And I think they could catch him. And if we had a real president, which we don't, we don't have a real president. We Have a man that is grossly inept and it's very dangerous because these guys are all at the top of their game. When you talk about President Xi and you talk about any one of the leaders in the world, Macron. And he's a smart guy, he's all for France. I mean, he would take the shirt off your back if you didn't know what you were doing.
INTERVIEWER: So when you're with these guys, are these guys all sharks?
TRUMP: Yeah.
INTERVIEWER: And you can sense the energy immediately?
TRUMP: Yeah. Not all of them, but. But some of them aren't sharks.
INTERVIEWER: How are you assessing personality?
TRUMP: Well, I can tell you, like, great Modi India.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: He's a friend of mine's. Great. He's the nicest. India. Yes. Oh, good. Well, I'll tell you. Do you like him or not?
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: Do you like.
INTERVIEWER: I. I have family on both sides of it. I have family that loves everything and family.
TRUMP: I just don't know. You need him. Well, they had, you know, before him, they had. They were replacing him every year. It was very unstable. He came along.
INTERVIEWER: He's in a lot of stuff.
TRUMP: He's great. He's a friend of mine. But on the outside, he looks like he's your father. He's the nicest. Total killer. Because I asked him. Yeah, we're talking. I did. They did a thing called Howdy, Modi in Houston, Texas.
INTERVIEWER: Oh, yeah?
TRUMP: Yeah. And they filled up the stadium. It was me and him. We filled up the stadium. It was beautiful. Like, 80,000 people was going crazy. And we're walking around today. Maybe I wouldn't be as. Maybe you wouldn't do that. But we're walking. We're walking in the middle, waving to everybody anyway. But we have a very good relationship. He's the nicest human being. But we had a couple of occasions where somebody was threatening India. I said, let me help. I'm very good with those people. Let me help. I will do it. I will do it, then. I will do anything necessary. We've defeated them for hundreds of years.
INTERVIEWER: Wow.
TRUMP: He was talking about a certain country. You can probably guess the country.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
INTERVIEWER: Can't fathom which.
TRUMP: You know, the country. But I said, whoa, what happened there? What happened? So, no, they're all tough and they're all smart and some are very good people. He's a good person. There's some good people and some aren't good people, but they're all at the top of their game. And we have her, who is now more important than him, I guess. Although he's still president of this country. We're talking about nuclear war and he's not capable. He doesn't even know what it is.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: He said yesterday when they talked about should they hit Iran's nuclear. No, no, you shouldn't do this. No, it's sort of just the opposite because the nuclear is the biggest threat we have in the world today. It's not global warming, where the oceans are rising one eighth of an inch in the next 500 years. The threat that we have, the biggest threat is nuclear war.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
INTERVIEWER: You seem concerned about that.
TRUMP: I am. Because. Because it only takes one. I am.
INTERVIEWER: Very true.
TRUMP: They have five countries now that have capability and soon they'll have more and we shouldn't let there be more. And I was at a point. Very good. Despite the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax. It was a total hoax and we were totally exonerated. Everything else I could have told them that the first day, but, but that causes, you know, a lot of problems. A lot of problems. And they're a big nuclear power. We were close to a deal for getting rid of nuclear weapons. It would be so good for all.
INTERVIEWER: Countries or just Russia.
TRUMP: We were talking about Russia ourselves and China.
INTERVIEWER: Oh, wow.
TRUMP: And we would then bring everyone else into it. And so you all, strongly, you all.
INTERVIEWER: Would get rid of your nuclear capabilities.
TRUMP: Denuclearize. Yes, we were going to get totally denuclearized because it's too powerful. It's too much.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: You know, my uncle, Dr. John Trump, was a doctor. Yeah, Dr. John Chap. Well, he was a nuclear doctor. Actually, he was at mit. He's the longest serving professor at mit. He passed away. Great guy. He was a brilliant guy, a brilliant scientist. And he used to tell me, he said a long time ago, he'd say, donald, someday it's very dangerous, somebody will be able to carry a small briefcase into a building in New York and blow up the entire city. I said, you gotta be kidding me, Uncle John, that will never happen. He was like a really brilliant guy. He was there for, I think, 41 years. He's the longest serving professor in the history of mit. Oh, wow. So when I understand physics and when I understand things well, they say, how come you. I have. There's good genetics, you know, I'm a believer. You guys believers in it. Were your parents funny? Were they comedians?
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, my, my mom's side was. Is, is Scottish.
TRUMP: Yeah.
INTERVIEWER: Scottish women tend to be, you know, my mom. Yeah, I was gonna ask you about that.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: And she was great.
INTERVIEWER: Which. Is that where you get your humor?
TRUMP: Yeah, well, I'll tell you what, England, at the time, they could.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: Fought them for a thousand years trying to get them undertow. They couldn't do it.
INTERVIEWER: Couldn't do it.
TRUMP: They're very tough. That reminds me of my mother, come to think of it, my mother was. My mother was great. She was Stornoway.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: The Hebrides. Right. That's, you know, that's really serious Scottish.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: But she was great. But it is true, when you see Braveheart, that was one of many times, you know, for hundreds.
INTERVIEWER: Did you watch that with your mom by any chance?
TRUMP: No, I didn't. I didn't get to. I'll tell you, I saw Braveheart. I think Mel Gibson is a very good guy. I've met him. Yeah, a number of times. Good guy. But out there, that was super. Mel Gibson in his prime.
INTERVIEWER: Oh, yeah.
TRUMP: And I was on a plane and there was absolutely nothing to do. It was one of these planes that you couldn't make calls you couldn't do.
INTERVIEWER: And they had tapes, that's all planes for us.
TRUMP: And they showed me. Like, they showed. No, but they showed. They showed me. Sir, we have 20 tapes. And I looked at the tapes that. They were all there. And this was like 20 years after it was made. This was probably six years ago. I never saw Braveheart.
INTERVIEWER: Okay.
INTERVIEWER: And.
TRUMP: Oh, wow. They showed me a tape. I say, all right, let's put that one on. And within about four minutes, I said, this may be the greatest movie. Incredible. Informant. No, I'm a Braveheart fan. But you, You've seen it?
INTERVIEWER: Oh, dude, I saw it with my mom.
TRUMP: I wish I saw it with my mother. But it was.
INTERVIEWER: Was that your Braveheart moment? Like after getting shot, when you stood up?
TRUMP: You don't think of that in those moments. You do what you do.
INTERVIEWER: Thank God you weren't thinking about Mel Gibson.
TRUMP: Nah, but he's. He's good. But he was. When he in prime time, he was unbelievable. I mean, at that, you know, his look, his way, his. You couldn't have had a better guy playing it. But it was. That was a great movie.
INTERVIEWER: So.
TRUMP: But it is true. England and, you know, prime for a thousand years. I mean, they'd have. And they'd have the battles with thousands or once a thousands. And they run at each other. Tell me that. I mean, you think that takes guts? They run at each other. I think so. Knowing they're going to pretty much die. Right.
INTERVIEWER: The Roman army built walls to keep out the Scottish.
TRUMP: When they were. Yeah, yeah. They were afraid of the skies.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, they're Afraid.
TRUMP: The Scottish people, they're tough people. They're good people, actually. They're very great people, but they're good fighters.
INTERVIEWER: But your mom was funny.
TRUMP: She was funny, yes.
INTERVIEWER: That's what I hear. I hear.
TRUMP: I hear she had a great sense of humor. And my father loved my mother. You know, they were married for.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
INTERVIEWER: Polar opposites, though.
TRUMP: Yeah. My father was German.
INTERVIEWER: Serious.
TRUMP: Serious, but good. He was a tough guy, but he had a good heart. When he walked down the street and they say we could walk down the street, he would always give something to. If there was somebody that had problems. He used to have the can and a pencil. You know, the can out. My father would always put $100 in that thing. He'd always do it. Now, he had a tremendous heart, but he was a tough guy. He was tough. He was just like. No, nonsense. It was firm. My mother was a woman. And I don't know how your mother felt, but she loved the queen. Don't forget. The queen was, you know, the queen was great. Oh, would she have liked. Because the queen honored me before she died. She honored me as the president in Buckingham palace. And there's nobody that does it like the English. There's nobody that has that, you know, the pomp and ceremony. But. But my mother would love that. Your mother. So did she feel strongly about, like, the royalty?
INTERVIEWER: I think they're obsessed with the royal family out there, like, in general.
TRUMP: Your mother. Your mother would have been.
INTERVIEWER: She was really into all the pageantry, for sure.
TRUMP: My mother was. Yeah. My mother thought the queen was great.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: She thought queen was so wonderful.
INTERVIEWER: So my family hates the English, though.
TRUMP: No, I know.
INTERVIEWER: There's some history there.
TRUMP: I know, I know. But. Yeah, but. But a lot of the. It's a hard breakup. You know, they tried to break up Scotland from. From the rest of the empire, so.
INTERVIEWER: To speak, because they got some oil.
TRUMP: And it made it by about, like, a half a point.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: They kept it together, so I hope it stays together. I hope it always stays together. But England, as they say, because it used to be England, but England never could. They just. And they were bigger.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: And they had more people.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: They could never finish it off by capturing Scotland. So it's really sort of.
INTERVIEWER: They ended up having to marry together.
TRUMP: They. They married. Yeah, they. They became sort of subsidiaries, right?
INTERVIEWER: Yes. Yeah.
TRUMP: But it was great. That's interesting with your mother.
INTERVIEWER: Guys, that little chunk of this scintillating conversation with President Trump has been brought to you by the great Company Steak partnered with us here on Flagrant, you know, steak is where you're going to do your gambling. That's where you're gonna go do your gambling.

Maybe some other things, because I think that's one thing, that there's bipartisan support for you is even the people that are like, I don't like that guy will go, hey, he's funny though. He says funny things. Have you heard this before?
TRUMP: Yeah, I've heard it.
INTERVIEWER: It's very disarming humor.
TRUMP: Yeah. But in my business, in what I do, if you don't have humor, you won't even survive.
INTERVIEWER: Why is that?
TRUMP: Because I think you have to have, you have to have a light side. I see a lot of dark things. I see horrible things. I see, I see things that are bad. I see political things that are hard. I mean, we have a lot of corrupt people in this country and I see it. And horrible corrupt people. We have people that, you know, I really do. We have from the inside, we have really bad people. And outside we do. But I think the outside is, but I think it's easier to handle China if you have a smart president who knows, you know, some things. If you had a. Who knows how to deal, let's say, yeah, you're not going to have a problem with Russia. You're not. Russia would have never attacked Ukraine if I were president. I used to talk to Putin about it. I got along great with him. They would have never ever done it. I ended his pipeline, you know, I ended the pipeline. Calls Nord Stream 2. Nobody ever heard of Nord Stream 2.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, yeah.
TRUMP: I said, are you building a pipeline going to Europe? Yeah. I said, I don't think so.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: And I told, I, you know, I got them together. I said, you mean we're defending you from Russia and you're paying billions of dollars a month for oil? It's not going to work that way. And I ended It. And then when Biden came in, he gave it back. The biggest project they ever had. Right. He gave it back. And then everyone said, trump is friends with Putin. And so Putin would say, if you're my friend, I'd hate like hell to see you as my enemy. Think of it. And I put a lot of sanctions on. But I got along with Russia. I get along with pretty much everybody. Actually, the tougher they were, the better I did with them. That's a good thing, not a bad thing, because the other ones are easier to handle. But the ones that I got along with, and they're also the bigger threats, I got along very well with President Xi of China, but when Covid came, I was not happy with him because it came out of the labs. I mean, they released it from accidentally, I believe. You know, a lot of people would say it wasn't an accident, but they got hit very hard. They got hit as hard as anybody in the world. You know, it was late. It was belated. It was a leaked hit.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: But when Covid came, I had, you know, I made an unbelievable trade deal with China. They have to buy $50 billion of our product every year. It was unbelievable. Nobody could believe I got that deal done. I don't even talk about it because of COVID I don't even talk about it. That deal is unbelievable. And what's happened now? Our farmers have been hit because Biden hasn't pressed them to honor the deal. You know, I used to. Every day I'd get up, how much did China buy today, sir? But I'd call them up. I'd say, you're behind. You have to buy 50 billion. Do you think Biden does that? Biden's sleeping. But I. Over the last week, I have what we talk about. Funny or sad? I think it's more sad than funny.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: He has one ability I don't have. Yeah, he sleeps. He can sleep. This guy goes on a beach and he lays down on one of those, you know, six ounce. They weigh six ounces, and you can't lift it. They're meant for. They're meant for children.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: Young people and old people. To lift. Yeah, they're aluminum. You know, hollowed aluminum. They weigh very little. And he can't lift. And somebody convinced him he looks good in a bathing suit. And when you're 82, typically bathing suits aren't going to make you look great. You're not going to be enhanced. Yeah. All right. It's just one of those things. I can't be sure about that. But yeah, typically, you know, depends what he's packing. He could, I don't know what the hell he's packing, but it's, I don't want, and I don't want to know. I don't know. But, but he has an ability to fall asleep while on camera. He can lie down on one of those things.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: And in minutes he's stone cold out. How does he do that? And he's got cameras because he's the president. So they have cameras on him.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, yeah.
TRUMP: And then they show him sleeping on the beach. Yeah, you'll never see me sleeping in front of camera.
INTERVIEWER: How do we get you better at that? Like what can we do? How do we work on that as a country?
TRUMP: As a country?
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: We got to save our country. Look, we are, we are, we are a nation in decline, whether you like it or not.
INTERVIEWER: I hate hearing that. I know, I hate that hurts me, that hurts me as a proud American.
TRUMP: I, I, well, what you like though is but we're going to be greater than ever before.
INTERVIEWER: So that's, I think the messaging that I think, yeah, I think that's really nice to hear.
TRUMP: Well, that's my ultimate message. But you can't avoid the fact that we've allowed 21 million people into our country in the last three and a half years. And I don't know your persuasion, I don't know if you guys are liberal or what, but nobody can be happy with 21 million people openly walking into a place we don't know. And it was released last week that 13,000 of those people are murderers. 13,099. 13,000 of those people are in prison, they're incarcerated for murder and they let them out.
INTERVIEWER: I think you have support on this though. I think every tremendous report regardless.
TRUMP: I think I'll let you know, I'll let you know on November 6th.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: If I have support. But day after the election, November pushback, the most important day. Yeah.
INTERVIEWER: I think people agree and they want a strong border and I think, I don't think that's an issue that's like tearing the country apart. But I do think that there is something here.
TRUMP: There are some people that want to open and, and they're either, but they're.
INTERVIEWER: Like politicians that are getting some sort of reinforcement through this. The average American I don't think is going to be an open border.
TRUMP: I think only a person that hates our country, actually maybe it's a down deep hatred can want open borders. So we took in 20 more than 21 million people in the last three and a half years and we have no idea where they even come from. They're terrorists, they're drug dealers, you know, in Venezuela. And it's not just South America, but take Venezuela. They've taken their criminals off the streets of Caracas, which was a very dangerous city. You couldn't walk across the street in Caracas and get a loaf of bread. Right now it's a safe city. Their crime is down 72%. They've taken all of their criminals, almost all of them, and they brought them into the United States and dumped them. That's not ending well. You know where some of them went to Aurora in Colorado and they took over the town. They took it over the old town. Oh, pretty much, yeah. You know how they took it over with guns. If they went into the real estate business like me, I had to go to a bank and borrow. Yeah, they went in with, with guns. MK 47. So they went in with, they went.
INTERVIEWER: It would have been so much weapons.
TRUMP: Like nobody's ever seen before. You know, they went in with military style weapons. They've taken it over.
INTERVIEWER: But I think most people on board with, with deporting any illegal that has committed a crime, like I think there is bipartisan support of that. I think the tricky thing comes, and honestly I have empathy. Like you're a business owner. There's been people, I'm not trying to out you, but like there's been people I'm sure that might not have had like legal citizenship that have maybe worked in various businesses and it's like, you know, I've definitely been taken care of as a kid by people that weren't legal babysitters and stuff. So there are people that maybe would like a path to citizenship that I have a lot of empathy.
TRUMP: You have to start with the criminals. Agreed. Okay. But maybe, but maybe we can, it's very tough.
INTERVIEWER: Maybe we can open our hearts a little bit to the people who are trying to be, you know, good, hard working America.
TRUMP: You know what's going to happen? You're going to be in the midst of this now. You know, Dwight Eisenhower was sort of a moderate. General Eisenhower, did you know that they had 8% generals, President of the United States? 8% were generals, 92% were politicians. And then you had Trump. See that's a wave. You know, we go off at this. I like that.
INTERVIEWER: Because now where are we weaving? I'm into this.
TRUMP: No, no, think of it because we're talking about generals. And then you get back on to the general. There you go. What I was going to say is that Eisenhower.
INTERVIEWER: I like the play for the week.
TRUMP: No, it's good, though, isn't it? Great. We go into it, we mentioned Eisenhower, and then I say he was a general. 8%, generals, 92%. And now you go back. Okay. It's part of the weave.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: Then you go back. No, you got to keep it all together. You got to be sharp. If you're not sharp, you're dead. Think of it. No, but think of it. So we have 92% and 8%. Nobody. No admirals.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: And no business people until me. So now we have me. I'm one.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: So I'm.
INTERVIEWER: And then maybe things change after that. Okay, here's.
TRUMP: No, I think it will change. There'll never be another business person that ever does this.
INTERVIEWER: Okay, here's the question.
TRUMP: Because I've been treated so badly that I think that no person of success. Don't forget, my whole life was deals, deals, deals, deals, deals, deals. Most guys are Stephs.
INTERVIEWER: Yes.
TRUMP: Like, they'll run for office. There's no deal. There's no nothing. You can't get yourself in trouble much.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: You can be a crooked politician. Some are.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: But basically, I do so many deals. I do hundreds of thousands of pages of documents a year, you know, as I'm. When I'm really in the mood. Right.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: And they find one page, I got myself a problem politically.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: Okay. Look at it. They went after me for years on taxes.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: Years.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: They went to the United States Supreme Court. I gave them tens of thousands of pages. And you never heard about it again.
INTERVIEWER: Well, that is what often happens, which is probably incredibly frustrating, which is lobbying an allegation. And then when it's proven to be false, they just move on.
TRUMP: Oh, they don't even write about it. I called the New York Times on something. I was right. And the Russian thing you're going to do. Yeah. The Russian hoax.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah. Yeah.
TRUMP: Well, I'm suing Pulitzer. You. You don't know this. They got a Pulitzer Prize for their New York Washington Post. Yeah. For the hooks, they got the Pulitzer Prize.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: So the writers got Pulitzer Prizes for their brilliant coverage of the Russia, Russia, Russia hoax.
INTERVIEWER: Interesting.
TRUMP: It turned out to be right. So, yeah. We wrote a letter to the Pulitzer Prize. Right. You know, the committee, it's a big foundation.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: And we said, we. It's. It's a lawsuit that's going on right now. And we said, we demanded you take back the Pulitzer Prizes. We demand a apology.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: Because you're actually by leaving them, you're, you know, you're sort of saying it happened and it didn't have. Everybody now is.
INTERVIEWER: You're giving them the lie.
TRUMP: Yeah, so I sued them. They said, well, we. We did what we did. We're not okay. That's okay. That's all right. So I sued them, and they've got themselves a big problem now, and this suit's moving along, and I think we're going to win that suit easily because they gave people Pulitzer Prizes that were wrong.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: You know, you should get the Pulitzer Prizes equivalent if you could. Guys like Sean Hannity, guys like, you know that there were numerous of them that. I mean, not as many as the fake news as the very liberal media, but we had tremendous. John Solomon, he's a great writer. So many people knew that that was a hoax. They should get prizes. I don't know. Pulitzer Prize. Because you don't get Pulitzer Prizes to a guy on television. You can't get, in theory, a Pulitzer Prize. But you had a lot of people that got that right. They got nothing. So we sued Pulitzer on the basis that they should absolutely take that prize back. And I said, by not taking it back, you're trying to say that it actually happened. You know, in a way, yeah. I'm saying you're defaming me because by you not taking those prizes, vacation, you're actually saying it happened.

TRUMP: Important thing, how are we doing so far? You're doing great.
INTERVIEWER: You're doing amazing. They're making us wrap up. We to want you.
TRUMP: For a long time I've been into my people, you know, I do have.
INTERVIEWER: Other things but I know you're busy, but we're.
TRUMP: How interesting is this though?
INTERVIEWER: See, this is the fun stuff.
TRUMP: He's a. Alex is a good influencer.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, he's a good kid.
TRUMP: You know, I asked him, I said, alex, let me ask you a question.
INTERVIEWER: Sure.
TRUMP: And I didn't I wasn't.
INTERVIEWER: Oh, you're not. We're not telling him.
TRUMP: He's got time now. Who is? Give. Give him a little more time. What the hell? Can I override Alex? I don't know. Yeah, unlike Biden, he can't. I can. I can. I can say, alex, I'm doing it. He'll say, thank you. They turn the cameras off with this guy. Do you ever see it? The cameras are off, the lights go off, everyone. He's in deep trouble. We're in no trouble. But I'll tell you what, I asked Alex. He's an influencer. You know, he's a very. He's a big name influencer. I don't know if he's in this league. I don't know who the hell know? But I said to him, knowing nothing about influencers, I said, who is the biggest of all the influencers, Sir? That's the easiest question you've ever asked me. Who is it you, sir.
INTERVIEWER: True.
TRUMP: I never thought of it. He said, you're the biggest. You have hundreds of millions of people. You have more people than anybody else by far. You know, before they took away. I went from having 280 million on Facebook and Twitter and Instagram, the three of them combined. 280. I think I was. I think I was number one because Zuckerberg told me that he came to the White House. He said, congratulations, you're number one on Facebook. You know, So I went from that to having nobody. I went. That was like cold turkey, right? You call that cold turkey? That would be like if we didn't do business with China one day. I said, no more business with China. You go cold turkey, right? And I went. And I said, boy. But I had a lot to say. This was after the presidency, of course. You know, they do it after the presidency, during the presidency.
INTERVIEWER: They were a little bit very nice.
TRUMP: But anyway. But they. I went totally, totally off. I had nobody and I had all these ideas and I couldn't get the word out. And I had some good thoughts and people want to hear my thoughts, and I did a thing called Save America Just. And essentially it was like the old fashioned. You guys are far too young. In the old days, what we did, we didn't have tweeting or we didn't have truth. Truth. Truth is doing great, by the way. Would you please use truth? I love truth. Use truth, everybody. It's my voice. But I also use X. I also use X. But I went from. I went from having all these people and I did an old fashioned Press release, it's called. We used to go to press release.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, yeah.
TRUMP: And somebody would write up something, send us all the. They started doing it. Save America. And they get. They got longer and better and longer and started doing it. And, man, I had millions of people he. Now, nobody else could do that because, you know, if somebody puts out a press release, it just doesn't work out too well. But I did it, and it did well. And then I did Truth, and. And I'm very good friends with Elon, and we owe Elon a lot for what he's done with X. And I use x2. I use x2, but my voice is on Truth and it's done really well. I mean, if I want to get something out, I. I put it on Truth and everybody picks it up.
INTERVIEWER: You know, that's the thing. You put it there and then you.
TRUMP: See other people picked up all over the place. It's picked up. I mean, I could be on. I want. But I put it out on Truth and it just gets picked up all over the place. So it's been very good. But he said I was the number one influencer. See the weave?
INTERVIEWER: The weave is great. Okay, question, Question. Okay. You've got your son Baron.
TRUMP: Do you think I'm the number one influence?
INTERVIEWER: I think it's it.
TRUMP: I think it's Rogan.
INTERVIEWER: I think it's Rogan. You and Kim Kardashian, like, Kim Kardashian influences the shape of women's bodies and faces. Like, you see so many. They're literal human beings.
TRUMP: Do they want to look like her?
INTERVIEWER: They want to look like her. So once we start seeing dudes want to look like you.
TRUMP: Yeah.
INTERVIEWER: And I see young Jack over there. I think he's trying to do it.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: Tell me. You know, this is a little new world. I call him. His name is Jack. I call him Tick Tock Jack. I'm good with names, you know. You are.
INTERVIEWER: You're very good.
TRUMP: Pocahontas, this.
INTERVIEWER: What about. And there was you. Tampon Tim was good.
TRUMP: What about Tampon Tim? It's hard to say. Yeah.
INTERVIEWER: In other words, it's a mouthful.
TRUMP: It's a lot t. And you can't stutter it through when you. It's really a lousy word to say.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: But it's quite accurate. Right. There are some. Like Comrade Kamala. It's a little hard to say she's comrade because she's obviously a communist.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: She's horrible. So I call her comrade.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah. Yeah.
TRUMP: And it's not bad. But when you put the names together. Yeah, it's a little. You got to be able to pume. Well, you got to be able to put it out there. But we have a lot of good. A lot of them I can't go into with you because some of my best ones are from the Republican primaries. They're all friends of mine. Now.
INTERVIEWER: You got to be nice.
TRUMP: Nice. So I've taken.
INTERVIEWER: What about Mike Pence? You got anything for Mike Pence?
TRUMP: Well, it's a shame because he and I had a very good relationship.
INTERVIEWER: Hanging out somewhere.
TRUMP: He couldn't cross the line of doing what was right, in my opinion. Some people would disagree with that. But he had the right to go and put them before the legislatures and have them reassess because they found out a lot of bad things. And he had a lawyer that said he didn't have that right, but he did have that right. And you know why we found out that that was true? Because they changed the law after the election so that he couldn't do what I said he could do.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: Okay. They changed the law so that a vice president could no longer do what I said he could do. So, in other words, I turned out to be right. But it's a shame. We had a very good relationship for 99.9% of the thing.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: And, you know, I think he's a good man. I think he's good. Unfortunately, I wish he would have had the stamina, maybe courage. Maybe both.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: To go further, because we have to have honest elections in our country, and if we're afraid to challenge an election, we're in big trouble. You know, they say if you. They've challenged elections. The Democrats. Look at Maxine Waters. How dare that. You know, they've challenged Stacey Abrams. Almost all of the Democrats challenge. Yeah, but when we challenge, they say he's a threat to democracy.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: These are con artists, and they're very bad for our country.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: So I'm going to weed them out. I'm going to weed them out. I'll do it in honor of you.
INTERVIEWER: Okay, so. So tell me this. So tell me this.
TRUMP: This situation.
INTERVIEWER: Okay. Baron is 18. He's handsome, he's tall, he's rich, he's got the whole. He's unleashed in New York City. Are you sure you want to reverse Roe v. Wade now? I mean, maybe give him a few years, you know.
TRUMP: You know, it's up to the states now. It's up to the states, because I have, and I believe in exceptions and all of the different things you've been vocal about that. I've been very. I think. I think a lot of people agree with me. You know, it was very, very strong, very, very tough. And Republicans were going to lose a lot of elections having to do with a lot of other things, too, because there are many issues. We have the border, we have this, we have wars, we have everything. And Roe v. Wade was always about getting it back to the states. And then people started talking about the number of weeks and this, that all these. But nobody wanted no legal scholar, no Democrat, no Republican liberal, conservative. Nobody wanted it in the federal government. It shouldn't be in the federal government. And the legal scholars. It was abhorrent. They didn't want it and they didn't want it in the federal government. And it was in the federal government. I know you said, sorry, what we did is. Right. What we did is we moved it back to the states and a vote of the people. And now they're voting. Ohio voted a very liberal, you know, Ohio. I won Ohio by a lot. But they, they voted. And it's up to them. Okay. I do believe in exceptions. Life of the mother and incest.
INTERVIEWER: Right.
TRUMP: If your daughter's raped by somebody.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: Let's say he's from a prison someplace and he's killed people and everything else. Absolutely. You have to be able to do. There are some people, and I think that group is smaller and smaller when they realize what's going on. But there are some people that under no circumstances can you do it. I don't happen to agree. Ronald Reagan didn't agree. But what has happened is it's now back in the states where it belongs, and the states are moving along and they're approving things. Some conservative and some liberal. There's a.
INTERVIEWER: There are some places. My wife and I had a baby through ivf. And you've been very supportive of ivf.
TRUMP: I was, totally.
INTERVIEWER: I really love that you said that you guys were gonna.
TRUMP: Right from the beginning.
INTERVIEWER: And I would love to get the refund or whatever once that happens.
TRUMP: But I actually said we want babies in our.
INTERVIEWER: And we do.
TRUMP: Yeah.
INTERVIEWER: But there are some people using that reversal of Roe v. Wade to kind of attack the legality of ivf. And to me, it's like, that's heartbreaking.
TRUMP: These are crooked politicians. These are politicians. Now I'll give you an example. I came out when it first came up, and it started in Alabama, where a judge ruled that you couldn't do ivf and all clinics all over Alabama was going to shut down, were going to be Shut down. And I wasn't an expert on ivf, but I have common sense. You know, we're the party of common sense. And some women called me, and actually, Katie Britt called me the senator from Alabama, who's really a young, good politician, smart, great husband, who was a football player, great family. She called me up, she said, sir, women have come to me and almost attacked me, and they're my best friends. That the judge shut down ivf. He's a very, you know, conservative judge, and he shut down ivf. And I said, let's explain it. Told me. And she told me. I said, no, it's a great thing. It's helping women have babies. And she didn't know her friends were all going through ivf.
INTERVIEWER: So much more common than people realize.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, well.
TRUMP: But they don't talk about it. You know, let's say somebody's. I mean, I understand nobody. I never had big discussions. I know this. If you're a woman and you're going to. You're not going to be telling Katie Britt, and you're not going to be telling your friends, hey, I'm going through ivf. Some will and some won't.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: But she didn't know anything about her friends, and they were good friends of hers. She said, they're literally attacking me. I said, well, what is it? After about five minutes, I'm a quick study. I said, that's a great thing. And I came out within 45 minutes of the decision. I came out strongly in favor on behalf of the Republican Party. And I have calls from senators saying, thank you, sir. You saved my political career.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah. Wow.
TRUMP: Because they might have come out, you.
INTERVIEWER: Know, saved their family, too.
TRUMP: But here's what does happen, which is really, we get calls that just the other day that this total lying politician that's running that ruined San Francisco, she destroyed San Francisco with her very liberal policies, and she destroyed the state.
INTERVIEWER: Gavin Newsom.
TRUMP: No, it's not, but Gavin Newsom, I call him Gavin Newscomb. Gavin Newsom. That's a good one. No, he's a terrible.
INTERVIEWER: That was pum.
TRUMP: He doesn't like that there. But he is good hair, though, Gavin. He probably does. Yeah.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, he is nice.
TRUMP: I don't know you.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, yeah.
TRUMP: So good. I don't know. Pretty good. Don't. Don't take your hat off. Because you never know. Sometimes the guy will take his hat off. He has good hair. Say, boy, you are. And usually it's false 95% of the time. There's always a reason you Know, usually a reason that's okay, too. But what I do, I get a call and they say that she, Kamala said that I'm against ivf. Okay, that I'm against it. They know it's untrue. But all of the lies, positioning, so many different things. The bloodbath that was about the auto industry, but the word is a tough word. China's going to take all our auto business if we go all electric and all this stuff. And the head of the union, I said, is a fool. He sold the union down. I'm doing great with you. Notice where the Teamsters like me and they all like me, the workers like me, because I'm going to.
INTERVIEWER: Seems to be.
TRUMP: That seems to be even. Even union unions that have never been with a Republican before are endorsing me. I mean, it's incredible. The Teamsters voted 61% in favor of Trump. Think of that. The. I'll tell you, the FBI would be. In fact, almost everybody. I think almost everybody would be in February.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: But they lie and they say. And they know it's a lie. Charlottesville. The Charlottesville statement was perfect. If they take the next sentence that I gave, I made a statement on it. It was a perfect statement. And if you take. But they never take the next sentence, they cut it off.
INTERVIEWER: And then there's no.
TRUMP: Even the other one. Patriot. Peacefully and patriotically. In my speech. Yeah, I talked about peacefully and patriotically. They never show that. They never talk about it to show you how dishonest they are. The J6 committee, I call it the unselect. You know, they call it the select committee. I call it the unselect committee of political hacks and thugs. They never talk about my speech because it was a good speech. It was a, you know, patriotic speech.
INTERVIEWER: Are you numb to this now or.
TRUMP: No? I never get bothering you. It bothers me. I'll tell you what bothers me. Kamala the other day said he is against ivf and everybody knows that that's false. When I came out, people were a little surprised, actually, because, you know, in theory, but I came out strongly in favor of ivf. She has an add on that I'm against ivf. She knows it's untrue. She has an add on that bloodbath. Bloodbath means like blood. And that's not what I was talking about. The automobile industry. It's going to be a bloodbath in the automobile. We're going to lose all our business. Yeah, that's what's referring to. When they do Things, and they do a lot. But I always refer him back to the simplicity of McDonald's. She lied about McDonald's. She lied about many things and she's a liar. You. There should be some kind of a rule. When they know it's a lie, you can't do a commercial on it. But this is a thing that's going to end in 29 days so they can say what they want. I have a hard time doing it to them because I'm basically, you know, I'm basically a truthful person. But. And frankly, no, but frankly, no, but frankly, she's given me so much ammunition. I don't really have to. She's a radical left lunatic who will destroy our nation other than that, but she'll destroy our nation. So when you take a look at it, and I think that, you know, just getting back to your original thought on having it back in the States, the people are now voting on it and we're going to put an end to a 52 year ordeal. This has been going on for 52 years.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: It's back with the states and it's a vote of the people. And that's where everybody wanted it to be. And I think that issue is largely quelled because of that.
INTERVIEWER: You've said, like Arizona, you think went a little bit too far. If you feel a state goes a little bit too far, will you use a little influence and say, hey, maybe an incest. We can make exceptions.
TRUMP: I would. Oh, no, I won't back it. I won't back it. I think, Eugene, I think that's important.
INTERVIEWER: For moderates to hear. That's what I want to give you.
TRUMP: But they're all changing because the people in the state won't stand for that. There are some states that say under no circumstances you have a daughter and she's raped by the worst, most violent criminal in the country and you cannot get, you know her, she, you cannot take.
INTERVIEWER: She has to live with that for the rest of her life.
TRUMP: She got to live with this. And you know, the father is a monster. He's from an insane asylum because he killed 50 people.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: And you're going to have that baby.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
INTERVIEWER: And I can't have empathy for that.
TRUMP: No. No. I can't believe that people are forced to do that.
INTERVIEWER: Yes.
TRUMP: And you have a tiny, you know, right now. Yeah, it was, it used to be a much bigger segment.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: No, I think I've done a good job in a lot of ways because I've convinced people that you just can't do that.
INTERVIEWER: No, that's important.
TRUMP: It's always been complex. It's always been tough stuff. But we've come a long way with that issue. But just in a nutshell, bringing it back to the states and giving a vote of the people is where they wanted it 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago. And then they got a little complex. They talked about the length and, you.
INTERVIEWER: Know, the number of weeks with protections, with protections for women.
TRUMP: To me, you have to. Ronald Reagan a long time ago was with the same three protections.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: He said he wanted, you know, for rape, incest and the life of the mother. And that was a long time ago.
INTERVIEWER: Okay, you have a very busy day. Before you go, what would you like your legacy to be and what do you think it will be?
TRUMP: So.
INTERVIEWER: And thank you very much for taking.
TRUMP: Two very different questions, actually, I think.
INTERVIEWER: But what would you like it to be?
TRUMP: I took over a country that was very troubled. This country was broken up and tremendous dissension. And Barack Obama started it. And if you take a look, it was very, very badly broken. And I think now with, with Biden, you know, let's forget her for a second. But with Biden and her part of it, big part of it. But with Biden, there's tremendous dissension. The country is a broken up mess and it's broken in a lot of ways. But what I would like my legacy to be is the same as the term maga. Make America great again. I'm going to make this country great again. It's not a great country right now. It's loaded up.
INTERVIEWER: It's always a great country. It's a great country. It's always a great country.
TRUMP: Okay? But I say it has the potential and it was a great country. I think now there's so much hatred and there's so much dissension. I think when you have people that can't walk down Fifth Avenue, when you have people that can't walk down a street, it ceases to be.
INTERVIEWER: We can always be better. We can always be better.
TRUMP: Yeah. But you can't blindfold yourself to say.
INTERVIEWER: I'm honest about it. But to me, I'm really proud of America because I think that I don't. I think I can be the best version of myself here. You know, I think that Donald Trump can only happen in America. Your life, what has happened to you? This is an American story. My mom's life is an American story. Like, my mom's from Scotland. She comes here and has all the success and she's so grateful of what America is. That doesn't mean that we can't make it better. I like the idea of making it better every single time. Fixing these things when there's leaks in the ship. But the idea of America and becoming the greatest version of yourself is something I'll always be proud of.
TRUMP: I understand what you're saying. When. When I was president, we had no wars in the whole world because of me. I stopped a lot of wars from him.
INTERVIEWER: That makes me proud.
TRUMP: Right. But it's just not happening now. Right now people are dying in Ukraine because we had an incompetent president. If we had a president that knew what the hell he was doing, Ukraine would have never happened. Israel would have never happened. All those people that are dying on both sides.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: That would have never happened. Afghanistan, people falling off airplanes from three. Think of that.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: From 3,500ft above the ground, three times the height of the Empire State Building off the side of the airplane. All of this horrible stuff would have never happened. Inflation would have never happened because that was caused by energy and the stupid energy.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: So look, we love our country.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: And it's had moments of greatness. But it's. I think it's. I think it's a very. It's a. It's a declining. It's so sad what's happened. We're a nation in decline and we can't let it be declined. I'll give you an example. We're going to lose our monetary base very soon because, you know, countries are going off the dollar. I'm going to get them back on the dollar. I'm going to say you got to go back on, though. You're not going to do any business with. You know, you got to do it. But I do think this where I really agree with you. We have tremendous potential. And I say it, make America great again.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: And I just want to. I, I would like to have it. I used to have something. I was going to use it, and I didn't use it because the country started to do badly. Cag. Not maga. Cag. I never liked the word cag, but it was keep America great. You like that?
INTERVIEWER: I like this.
TRUMP: But see, I, I couldn't use it because we had so many problems.
INTERVIEWER: So I want to say it sounds like that other word.
TRUMP: It doesn't work as well. Look, there's never going to be another maga. I don't know. I came up with a phrase that just turned out to be a maggot.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: No, it's the greatest movement, political movement in the history of our country. And these are people that really love our country and they want it to be great and we're going to make it great again. That was what I would like to do, is make this country so great, better than what you're even thinking. And you are. I mean, I love your attitude because I think that's the way you should be.
INTERVIEWER: I think that's.
INTERVIEWER: Sorry.
INTERVIEWER: There's one thing I want to give you, a rumor I'd like to give you a chance to dispel. And then one question if you have time, I'd like to ask selfishly.
TRUMP: Rumor.
INTERVIEWER: The far left, I think, says this thing that if Donald Trump wins, he's never going to cede power. Then they have some clip of you saying, just vote for me one time, you won't have to vote again. I don't believe this is true. I want to give you a chance to publicly say that's nonsense, just so you can publicly speak. Any moderates out there?
TRUMP: What I said, yeah. Christians tend to vote at a very low percentage for some reason, and so do gun owners. Would you believe it? The NRA gun owners tend not to vote. Maybe it's a rebellious thing. I don't know. Maybe I said, look, our country's in big trouble, really big trouble with the border, with all the problems. We can solve the problem, but vote this one time. After that, we're not going to need it. This is the most important election in the history of our country. Vote for this most important election. And then if you don't want to vote, we're going to have elections. But you don't have to vote because it's going to go along swimmingly.
INTERVIEWER: That's how I interpreted it.
TRUMP: That's how they interpreted it, too.
INTERVIEWER: They know what they're doing.
TRUMP: You got to vote this time because we don't have. We can't wait four years. Because you know what? In another four years, like we've just had with this clown that's a president, that's just a clown. A foolish man. Don't forget, he was a stupid man 25 years ago. He was never a smart man. He's run many times. Isn't it amazing? He's run many times and he gets it when he's in serious decline. Okay. But anyway, so everybody knows that. And that's what I meant by it.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: It means we gotta fix it.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: And then it's gonna work beautifully. It's gonna run beautiful. We're gonna have elections every two Years and every four years, it's gonna be great.
INTERVIEWER: I just want to give you a chance to say that to mine. And if I could ask one question, everybody I speak to, every race, creed, whatever, they don't just like you, they love you.
INTERVIEWER: You.
INTERVIEWER: And I talk to people on both sides about your policies, and a lot of people that like your policies. The China tariff that's still in place right now is an example of policy that people love. I think sometimes what we love about you as comedians is you shoot from the hip, but then that gets twisted into this rhetoric that adds gasoline onto everything. So the one thing I would like, as I think a moderate person, is maybe if you get elected, would you be a little bit more mindful of how powerful your words are, for better and for worse?
TRUMP: And I'm going to think of you every time. Let's go. I'm going to actually vote. No. No, it's true. I mean, I understand that sometimes they say, oh, could you be a little bit more. But you're doing a lot of things and you're solving a lot of problems. I stopped wars that nobody will ever know about, they won't write about, but countries that were fighting each other and didn't affect us much, but they did business with us. I called up two countries that have fought themselves, fought for thousands of years, killing each other for years. And I said, you guys are at it again. I heard it was going to start up. I stopped it when I first came in, and I said, listen, here's the story. If you go to war with each other, I could give you the details, but I don't even want to bother because it's nice now. I said, you're not going to do any more business with the United States. I'm going to cut you off 100%. And if you do get through, I'm going to charge you 200% tariffs. You won't be able to survive. So work it out. Work it out. You know, it was a country that split, and then they've been fighting for years. The two halves, I think, like thousands. I get a call and I forget about it. But I had a rough call with them, and I said, I'm going to charge you tariffs, and I'm going to. You're not going to do. You're going to be cut off. No more business. And if they don't have the United States, it's a problem, and we have to keep it that way. We have to keep our country strong so we can do this. I mean, if our country is weak. We don't have that. You know, if we keep getting weaker and weaker, which is happening, we're not going to let that happen. So I get a call two weeks later, two days later, sir, we've worked it all out. Thank you very much. And I go about my business. I save thousands of lives, hundreds of thousands of lives. They've been killing each other for years, for centuries. And I save thousands of lives, and nobody writes about it. It. Many people don't even know. That's the reason, you know, things are good. And I had it out with him. I said, you guys are crazy. You do that, no more doing business with the United States. You're cut off a hundred percent. You're dead. You're not going to do 10 cents worth of business. And I even said the tariff thing, but the first poo is actually even more powerful. And that's it. I forget about it. I'd go about doing my business. Two days later, I said, congratulations. What? What? On what? So and so and so and so. They're not going to have a war. They made peace. I've done so many things like that, and none of them hit the news. Most of them are. None of them are known. Most of them aren't really known. You know, I. I've made. I've made countries do things for us because they were treating us unfairly. And I've gotten things for our country that nobody else, I really think nobody else could have done. But I enjoy doing it for our country. And, you know, just to get back to where you originally started it, I want to make America great again. I want to make it so great that people won't question it. So that people can say what you just said, that. No, no, it's great. I don't want to have a question. Why should I or anybody else say, no, it's not great anymore. Yeah, I don't want to be in that position. I think I want to make it so that when you ask a question like that, we can say, well, it's a great, great country. We love our country, but we can do a couple of little things.
INTERVIEWER: I think we need that.
TRUMP: I'll put that in our. We want to put that love basket. I love that.
INTERVIEWER: And. And, well, first of all, thank you so much for this. I would be remiss to not even bring this up. You've said that you want to have peace in these places, not just Russia and Ukraine. It's obviously in the Middle East. I know that is a very tough task. I don't think maybe you get enough credit for what you accomplished in your administration. Accomplished? With the Abraham Accords.
TRUMP: The Abraham Accords. And they did nothing.
INTERVIEWER: Yeah.
TRUMP: Again, Iran was willing to do a deal. I would have had a deal with Iran. And within seven days after the election, I actually said, let's delay it till after the election because I was sure we're going to win the election. But things happened, you know, Covid happened.
INTERVIEWER: Of course, there was a lot of things.
TRUMP: Look, it was a mess, but still.
INTERVIEWER: I think it's something that a diplomacy out in that region that hasn't existed prior. Is that something? I would imagine it would be at the forefront of this next administrative administration.
TRUMP: You know, there are great philosophers that said, the world will end in the Middle East. We're not going to let that happen. You've heard that expression, they said the world will end someday in the Middle East. We're not going to let that happen.
INTERVIEWER: Okay, well, listen, thank you so much. Thank you so much, Mr. President. I really appreciate it, guys.
TRUMP: Thank you very much. Thank you so much.
INTERVIEWER: That was awesome.
