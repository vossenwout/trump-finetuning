INTERVIEWER: First of all, during the war, everybody has problems, even you. But you have nice ocean and don't feel now, but you will feel it in the future.
TRUMP: God bless. You don't know that.
INTERVIEWER: God bless. God bless. You are not war.
TRUMP: Don't tell us what we're going to feel. We're trying to solve a problem. Don't tell us what we're going to feel.
INTERVIEWER: I'm not telling you because you're in.
TRUMP: No position to dictate that. Remember this. You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel. We're going to feel very good. We're going to feel very good and very strong.
INTERVIEWER: You will feel influenced.
TRUMP: You're right now not in a very good position. You've allowed yourself to be in a.
INTERVIEWER: Very bad position, and he happens to be right about it from the very beginning of the war.
TRUMP: You're not in a good position. You don't have the cards right now with us. You start having cars right now. You don't. You're playing cards. You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. You're gambling with World War Three. You're gambling with World War iii. And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country that's backed you far more than a Lot of people said they should have.
INTERVIEWER: Please. You think that if you will speak very loudly about the war.
TRUMP: He's not speaking loudly. He's not speaking loudly. Your country is in big trouble. Can I help you?
INTERVIEWER: Wait a minute.
TRUMP: No, no. You've done a lot of talking. Your country is in big trouble.
INTERVIEWER: I know.
TRUMP: You're not winning. You're not winning this. You have a damn good chance of coming out okay because of Mr. President.
INTERVIEWER: We are staying in our country, staying strong. From the very beginning of the war, we've been alone and we are thankful. I said thanks.
TRUMP: You haven't been in this cabinet.
INTERVIEWER: You haven't been alone.
TRUMP: We gave you, through this stupid president, $350 billion. You gave military equipment, and your men are brave, but they had to use our military. What about if you didn't have our military equipment?
INTERVIEWER: You invited.
TRUMP: If you didn't have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks.
INTERVIEWER: In three days. I heard it from Putin. In three days. This is something maybe less. In two weeks. Of course, yes.
TRUMP: It's going to be a very hard thing to do, business like this.
TRUMP: But you see, I think it's good for the American people to see what's going on. I think it's very important. That's why I kept this going so long. You have to be thankful you don't have the cards. You're buried there. Your people are dying. You're running low on soldiers.
INTERVIEWER: Listen, don't play.
TRUMP: You're running low on soldiers. It would be a damn good thing. Then you tell us. I don't want to cease fire. I don't want a ceasefire. I want to go and I want this. Look, if you could get a ceasefire right now, I tell you, you take it so the bullets stop flying. And you meant stuff getting killed.
INTERVIEWER: Of course we want to stop the.
TRUMP: War, but you're saying you don't want to cease. I said to you, I want to cease with guarantees, because you'll get a ceasefire faster than any. Great.
INTERVIEWER: Ask our people about ceasefire, what they think that was for you what?
TRUMP: That wasn't with me. That was with a guy named Biden who was not a smart person. That was your. That was with Obama.
INTERVIEWER: It was your president.
TRUMP: Excuse me. That was with Obama. Who gave you sheets. And I gave you javelins. Yes, I gave you the javelins to take out all those tanks. Obama gave you sheets. In fact, the statement is obama gave sheets and Trump gave javelins. You got to be more thankful because let me tell you, you don't have the cards. With us, you have the cards, but without us, you don't have any cards.
Speaker D: One more question to Martin, Mr. Vice President. President, I'm sorry.
TRUMP: It'll be a tough deal to make because the attitudes have to change.
Speaker D: What if Russia breaks ceasefire? What if Russia breaks peace talks? What do you do then? I understand that it's a heated conversation right now.
TRUMP: What are you saying?
TRUMP: What if they. What if anything? What if a bomb drops on your head right now? Okay, what if they break it? I don't know. They broke it with Biden because Biden, they didn't respect him. They didn't respect Obama. They respect me. Let me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia. You ever hear of that deal? That was a phony. That was a phony Hunter Biden, Joe Biden scam, Hillary Clinton, shifty Adam Schiff. It was a Democrat scam, and he had to go through that. And he did go through it. We didn't end up in a war, and he went through it. He was accused of all that stuff. He had nothing to do with it. It came out of Hunter Biden's bathroom. It came out of Hunter Biden's bedroom. It was disgusting. And then they said, oh, oh, the laptop from hell was made by Russia, the 51 agents. The whole thing was a scam. And he had to put up with that. He was being accused of all that stuff. All I can say is he might have broken deals with Obama and Bush and he might have broken them with Biden. He did. Maybe, maybe he didn't. I don't know what happened, but he didn't break them with me. He wants to make a deal. I don't know if you can make a deal. The problem is I've empowered you to be a tough guy, and I don't think you'd be a tough guy without the United States. And your people are very brave, but you're either going to make a deal or we're out. And if we're out, you'll fight it out. I don't think it's going to be pretty, but you'll fight it out. But you don't have the cards. But once we sign that deal, you're in a much better position. But you're not acting at all thankful. And that's not a nice thing. I'll be honest. That's not a nice thing. All right, I think we've seen enough. What do you think? This is going to be great television. I will say that. All right. We'll see what we can do about putting. Go back.
INTERVIEWER: Guys.
TRUMP: Come on.
INTERVIEWER: Let's go.
TRUMP: We'll see. I don't know. All right, guys, come on, please. Hey.
