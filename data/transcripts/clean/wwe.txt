INTERVIEWER: Why are you here?
TRUMP: Let me put it very simply. I'm taller than you. I'm better looking than you. I think I'm stronger than you.
INTERVIEWER: Wow.
INTERVIEWER: Wait a minute. I know you have an ego, but I had no idea it was that big, all right? I mean, come on. You would have challenged me to a match in Wrestlemania.
TRUMP: Absolutely. 100%. I will kick your ass.
INTERVIEWER: I appreciate your proposal, but I. I think I have a counter proposal. Since I'm actually unable to physically compete, why don't I find a representative? Why don't I find a hand picked competitor to represent me? You find someone to represent you. I'll be in my guy's corner, you'll be in his. What do you say? Put her there.
TRUMP: I don't like it. I don't like it. I really don't like it. I'll tell you what. You're a rich guy, I'm a richer guy.
INTERVIEWER: What is your proposal to settle this game?
TRUMP: Let me tell you something. You deal in cash all the time. I deal in cash all the time. It comes a time where that gets a little boring. I have another idea. You pick a representative, I'll pick a representative. If you lose, I get to shave your head.
INTERVIEWER: Well, the answer is no, and I'll tell you why. No, really. I'm not going to be embarrassed by Trump again. He's got something up his sleeve. I know damn well no.
INTERVIEWER: I can't believe Mister McMahon is backing away from this challenge.
TRUMP: I've known you a long time. And honestly, until now, I always thought you had guts. You don't have guts.
INTERVIEWER: I still think you've got something up your sleeve, Mister Trump. And you know what? The match is all.
